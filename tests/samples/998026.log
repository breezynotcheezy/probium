    {pci,pnp} quirks.c: don't use deprecated print_fn_descriptor_symbol()
    
    I dunno how this missed Bjorn and his quest to use %pF in commit
    c80cfb0406c01bb5da91bfe30f5cb1fd96831138 ("vsprintf: use new vsprintf
    symbolic function pointer format"), but it did.
    
    So use %pF in the two remaining places that still tried to print out
    function pointers by hand.

    Fix kernel/softirq.c printk format warning properly
    
    This fixes the broken 77af7e3403e7314c47b0c07fbc5e4ef21d939532
    ("softirq, warning fix: correct a format to avoid a warning") fix
    correctly.
    
    The type of a pointer subtraction is not "int", nor is it "long".  It
    can be either (or something else).  It's "ptrdiff_t", and the printk
    format for it is "%td".

    FRV: Eliminate NULL test and memset after alloc_bootmem
    
    As noted by Akinobu Mita in patch b1fceac2b9e04d278316b2faddf276015fc06e3b,
    alloc_bootmem and related functions never return NULL and always return a
    zeroed region of memory.  Thus a NULL test or memset after calls to these
    functions is unnecessary.

    Use the generic pci_enable_resources() instead of the arch-specific code.
    
    Unlike this arch-specific code, the generic version:
        - checks PCI_NUM_RESOURCES (11), not 6, resources
        - skips resources that have neither IORESOURCE_IO nor IORESOURCE_MEM set
        - skips ROM resources unless IORESOURCE_ROM_ENABLE is set

    Configure out AIO support
    
    This patchs adds the CONFIG_AIO option which allows to remove support
    for asynchronous I/O operations, that are not necessarly used by
    applications, particularly on embedded devices. As this is a
    size-reduction option, it depends on CONFIG_EMBEDDED. It allows to
    save ~7 kilobytes of kernel code/data:

    W1: ds2490.c optimize ds_set_pullup
    
    Optimize the ds_set_pullup function.  For a strong pullup to be sent the
    ds2490 has to have both the strong pullup mode enabled, and the specific
    write operation has to have the SPU bit enabled.  Previously the write
    always had the SPU bit enabled and both the duration and model was set
    when a strong pullup was requested.  Now the strong pullup mode is enabled
    at initialization time, the delay is updated only when the value changes,
    and the write SPU bit is set only when a strong pullup is required.  This
    removes two or three bus transactions per strong pullup request.

    W1: ds2490.c reset ds2490 in init
    
    Reset the device in init as it can be in a bad state.  This is necessary
    because a block write will wait for data to be placed in the output buffer
    and block any later commands which will keep accumulating and the device
    will not be idle.  Another case is removing the ds2490 module while a bus
    search is in progress, somehow a few commands get through, but the input
    transfers fail leaving data in the input buffer.  This will cause the next
    read to fail see the note in ds_recv_data.

    - add result register #defines
    - rename ds_dump_status to ds_print_msg
    - rename ds_recv_status to ds_dump_status
    - ds_dump_status prints the requested status and no longer reads the
      status, this is because the second status read can return different
      data for example the result register
    - the result register will be printed, though limited to detecting a
      new device, detecting other values such as a short would require
      additional reporting methods
    - ST_EPOF was moved to ds_wait_status to clear the error condition

    W1: ds2490.c simplify and fix ds_touch_bit
    
    Simplify and fix ds_touch_bit.  If a device is attached in the middle of a
    bus search the status register will return more than the default 16 bytes.
     The additional bytes indicate that it has detected a new device.  The way
    ds_wait_status is coded, if it doesn't read 16 status bytes it returns an
    error value.  ds_touch_bit then will detect that error and return an
    error.  In that case it doesn't read the input buffer and returns
    uninitialized data.  It doesn't stop there.  The next transaction will not
    expect the extra byte in the input buffer and the short read will cause an
    error and clear out both the old byte and new data in the input buffer.
    
    Just ignore the value of ds_wait_status.  It is still required to wait
    until ds2490 is again idle and there is data to read when ds_recv_data is
    called.  This also removes the while loop.  None of the other commands
    wait and verify that the issued command is in the status register.

    see a comment like this in the code.  "We'll wait a bit longer just to be
    sure." If they are going to calculate delaying 324.9us, but actually delay
    500us, why not just give up the CPU and sleep?  This is designed for a
    battery powered ARM system, avoiding busywaiting has to be good for
    battery life.
    
    I sent a request for testers March 7, 2008 to the Linux kernel mailing
    list and two developers who have patches for ds1wm.c, but I didn't get
    any respons.

    W1: w1_therm fix user buffer overflow and cat
    
    Fixed data reading bug by replacing binary attribute with device one.
    
    Switching the sysfs read from bin_attribute to device_attribute.  The data
    is far under PAGE_SIZE so the binary interface isn't required.  As the
    device_attribute interface will make one call to w1_therm_read per file
    open and buffer, the result is, the following problems go away.
    
    buffer overflow:
    	Execute a short read on w1_slave and w1_therm_read_bin would still
    	return the full string size worth of data clobbering the user space
    	buffer when it returned.  Switching to device_attribute avoids the
    	buffer overflow problems.  With the snprintf formatted output dealing
    	with short reads without doing a conversion per read would have
    	been difficult.
    bad behavior:
    	`cat w1_slave` would cause two temperature conversions to take place.
    	Previously the code assumed W1_SLAVE_DATA_SIZE would be returned with
    	each read.  It would not return 0 unless the offset was less
    	than W1_SLAVE_DATA_SIZE.  The result was the first read did a
    	temperature conversion, filled the buffer and returned, the
    	offset in the second read would be less than
    	W1_SLAVE_DATA_SIZE and also fill the buffer and return, the
    	third read would finnally have a big enough offset to return 0
    	and cause cat to stop.  Now w1_therm_read will be called at
    	most once per open.

    W1: feature, enable hardware strong pullup
    
    Add a strong pullup option to the w1 system.  This supplies extra power
    for parasite powered devices.  There is a w1_master_pullup sysfs entry and
    enable_pullup module parameter to enable or disable the strong pullup.
    
    The one wire bus requires at a minimum one wire and ground.  The common
    wire is used for sending and receiving data as well as supplying power to
    devices that are parasite powered of which temperature sensors can be one
    example.  The bus must be idle and left high while a temperature
    conversion is in progress, in addition the normal pullup resister on
    larger networks or even higher temperatures might not supply enough power.
     The pullup resister can't provide too much pullup current, because
    devices need to pull the bus down to write a value.  This enables the
    strong pullup for supported hardware, which can supply more current when
    requested.  Unsupported hardware will just delay with the bus high.
    
    The hardware USB 2490 one wire bus master has a bit on some commands which
    will enable the strong pullup as soon as the command finishes executing.
    To use strong pullup, call the new w1_next_pullup function to register the
    duration.  The next write command will call set_pullup before sending the
    data, and reset the duration to zero once it returns.
    
    Switched from simple_strtol to strict_strtol.

    W1: abort search early on on exit
    
    Early abort if the master driver or the hardware goes away in the middle
    of a bus search operation.  The alternative is to spam the print buffer up
    to 64*64 times with read errors in the case of USB.

    W1: fix deadlocks and remove w1_control_thread
    
    w1_control_thread was removed which would wake up every second and process
    newly registered family codes and complete some final cleanup for a
    removed master.  Those routines were moved to the threads that were
    previously requesting those operations.  A new function
    w1_reconnect_slaves takes care of reconnecting existing slave devices when
    a new family code is registered or removed.  The removal case was missing
    and would cause a deadlock waiting for the family code reference count to
    decrease, which will now happen.  A problem with registering a family code
    was fixed.  A slave device would be unattached if it wasn't yet claimed,
    then attached at the end of the list, two unclaimed slaves would cause an
    infinite loop.
    
    The struct w1_bus_master.search now takes a pointer to the struct
    w1_master device to avoid searching for it, which would have caused a
    lock ordering deadlock with the removal of w1_control_thread.

    tpm: work around bug in Broadcom BCM0102 chipset
    
    Patch tpm-correct-tpm-timeouts-to-jiffies-conversion reveals a bug in the
    Broadcom BCM0102 TPM chipset used in the Dell Latitude D820 - although
    most of the timeouts are returned in usecs as per the spec, one is
    apparently returned in msecs, which results in a too-small value leading
    to a timeout when the code treats it as usecs.  To prevent a regression,
    we check for the known too-short value and adjust it to a value that makes
    things work.

    tpm: correct tpm timeouts to jiffies conversion
    
    This patch fixes timeouts conversion to jiffies, by replacing
    msecs_to_jiffies() calls with usecs_to_jiffies().  According to TCG TPM
    Specification Version 1.2 Revision 103 (pages 166, 167) TPM timeouts and
    durations are returned in microseconds (usec) not in miliseconds (msec).
    
    This fixes a long hang while loading TPM driver, if TPM chip starts in
    "Idle" state instead of "Ready" state.  Without this patch - 'modprobe'
    may hang for 30 seconds or more.

    Make the Thermal messages (temperature got past Tmid) be displayed only
    once because:
    
    1) it's the BIOS job to configure and handle the memory throttling
    2) if the BIOS is broken or is aware about the condition, flooding the
       system logs won't help anything.
    3) According to the specification update for Intel 5000 MCHs, all the
       revisions of this MCH have problems on the thermal sensors, making
       not automatic (a.k.a. intelligent thermal throttling) impossible.

    block: sanitize invalid partition table entries
    
    We currently follow blindly what the partition table lies about the
    disk, and let the kernel create block devices which can not be accessed.
    Trying to identify the device leads to kernel logs full of:
      sdb: rw=0, want=73392, limit=28800
      attempt to access beyond end of device
    
    Here is an example of a broken partition table, where sda2 starts
    behind the end of the disk, and sdb3 is larger than the entire disk:
      Disk /dev/sdb: 14 MB, 14745600 bytes
      1 heads, 29 sectors/track, 993 cylinders, total 28800 sectors
         Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
      /dev/sdb1              29        7800        3886   83  Linux
      /dev/sdb2           37801       45601        3900+  83  Linux
      /dev/sdb3           15602       73402       28900+  83  Linux
      /dev/sdb4           23403       28796        2697   83  Linux
    
    The kernel creates these completely invalid devices, which can not be
    accessed, or may lead to other unpredictable failures:
      grep . /sys/class/block/sdb*/{start,size}
      /sys/class/block/sdb/size:28800
      /sys/class/block/sdb1/start:29
      /sys/class/block/sdb1/size:7772
      /sys/class/block/sdb2/start:37801
      /sys/class/block/sdb2/size:7801
      /sys/class/block/sdb3/start:15602
      /sys/class/block/sdb3/size:57801
      /sys/class/block/sdb4/start:23403
      /sys/class/block/sdb4/size:5394
    
    With this patch, we ignore partitions which start behind the end of the disk,
    and limit partitions to the end of the disk if they pretend to be larger:
      grep . /sys/class/block/sdb*/{start,size}
      /sys/class/block/sdb/size:28800
      /sys/class/block/sdb1/start:29
      /sys/class/block/sdb1/size:7772
      /sys/class/block/sdb3/start:15602
      /sys/class/block/sdb3/size:13198
      /sys/class/block/sdb4/start:23403
      /sys/class/block/sdb4/size:5394
    
    These warnings are printed to the kernel log:
      sdb: p2 ignored, start 37801 is behind the end of the disk
      sdb: p3 size 57801 limited to end of disk

    binfmt_elf_fdpic: wire up AT_EXECFD, AT_EXECFN, AT_SECURE
    
    These auxvec entries are the only ones left unhandled out of the current
    base implementation. This syncs up binfmt_elf_fdpic with linux/auxvec.h
    and current binfmt_elf.

    binfmt_elf_fdpic: convert initial stack alignment to arch_align_stack()
    
    binfmt_elf_fdpic seems to have grabbed a hard-coded hack from an ancient
    version of binfmt_elf in order to try and fix up initial stack alignment
    on multi-threaded x86, which while in addition to being unused, was also
    pushed down beyond the first set of operations on the stack pointer,
    negating the entire purpose.
    
    These days, we have an architecture independent arch_align_stack(), so we
    switch to using that instead. Move the initial alignment up before the
    initial stores while we're at it.

    binfmt_elf_fdpic: support auxvec base platform string
    
    Commit 483fad1c3fa1060d7e6710e84a065ad514571739 ("ELF loader support for
    auxvec base platform string") introduced AT_BASE_PLATFORM, but only
    implemented it for binfmt_elf.
    
    Given that AT_VECTOR_SIZE_BASE is unconditionally enlarged for us, and
    it's only optionally added in for the platforms that set
    ELF_BASE_PLATFORM, wire it up for binfmt_elf_fdpic, too.

    fs/reiserfs: use an IS_ERR test rather than a NULL test
    
    In case of error, the function open_xa_dir returns an ERR pointer, but
    never returns a NULL pointer.  So a NULL test that comes after an IS_ERR
    test should be deleted.
    
    The semantic match that finds this problem is as follows:
    (http://www.emn.fr/x-info/coccinelle/)
    
    // <smpl>
    @match_bad_null_test@
    expression x, E;
    statement S1,S2;
    @@
    x = open_xa_dir(...)
    ... when != x = E
    (
    *  if (x == NULL && ...) S1 else S2
    |
    *  if (x == NULL || ...) S1 else S2
    )

    hfs: fix namelength memory corruption
    
    Fix a stack corruption caused by a corrupted hfs filesystem.  If the
    catalog name length is corrupted the memcpy overwrites the catalog btree
    structure.  Since the field is limited to HFS_NAMELEN bytes in the
    structure and the file format, we throw an error if it is too long.

    This happens because the return value of read_mapping_page() is passed on
    to kmap unchecked.  The bug is triggered after the first
    read_mapping_page() in hfsplus_block_allocate(), this patch fixes all
    three usages in this functions but leaves the ones further down in the
    file unchanged.

    hfsplus: fix Buffer overflow with a corrupted image
    
    When an hfsplus image gets corrupted it might happen that the catalog
    namelength field gets b0rked.  If we mount such an image the memcpy() in
    hfsplus_cat_build_key_uni() writes more than the 255 that fit in the name
    field.  Depending on the size of the overwritten data, we either only get
    memory corruption or also trigger an oops like this:

    ext2: avoid printk floods in the face of directory corruption
    
    A very large directory with many read failures (either due to storage
    problems, or due to invalid size & blocks from corruption) will generate a
    printk storm as the filesystem continues to try to read all the blocks.
    This flood of messages can tie up the box until it is complete - which may
    be a very long time, especially for very large corrupted values.
    
    This is fixed by only reporting the corruption once each time we try to
    read the directory.

    ext2: fix ext2 block reservation early ENOSPC issue
    
    We could run into ENOSPC error on ext2, even when there is free blocks on
    the filesystem.
    
    The problem is triggered in the case the goal block group has 0 free
    blocks , and the rest block groups are skipped due to the check of
    "free_blocks < windowsz/2".  Current code could fall back to non
    reservation allocation to prevent early ENOSPC after examing all the block
    groups with reservation on , but this code was bypassed if the reservation
    window is turned off already, which is true in this case.
    
    This patch fixed two issues:
    1) We don't need to turn off block reservation if the goal block group has
    0 free blocks left and continue search for the rest of block groups.
    
    Current code the intention is to turn off the block reservation if the
    goal allocation group has a few (some) free blocks left (not enough for
    make the desired reservation window),to try to allocation in the goal
    block group, to get better locality.  But if the goal blocks have 0 free
    blocks, it should leave the block reservation on, and continues search for
    the next block groups,rather than turn off block reservation completely.
    
    2) we don't need to check the window size if the block reservation is off.
    
    The problem was originally found and fixed in ext4.

    fbdev: allow more chip revisions in Epson s1d13... video driver
    
    The Epson s1d13xxx hardware is common in many handhelds, but our driver is
    currently locked to a single chip revision.  This patch adds an array of
    known to work revisions (which can be extended).

    fbdev: ignore VESA modes if framebuffer does not support them
    
    Currently, it is possible to set a graphics VESA mode at boot time via the
    vga= parameter even when no framebuffer driver supporting this is
    configured.  This could lead to the system booting with a black screen,
    without a usable console.
    
    Fix this problem by only allowing to set graphics modes at boot time if a
    supporting framebuffer driver is configured.

    uvesafb: don't treat mode info retrieval failures as errors
    
    Some BIOSes return error codes when queried for information about
    modes from their own modelist.  uvesafb treats this as an error
    case and bails out.
    
    Change this behavior so that broken modes do not prevent the driver
    from working.  Only the failure to retrieve information about any
    usable video mode is considered to be an error case.

    radeonfb: accelerate imageblit and other improvements
    
    Implement support for HW color expansion of 1bpp images, along with some
    improvements to the FIFO handling and other accel operations.
    
    The offset fixup code is now unnecessary as the fbcon core will call our
    set_par upon switch back from KD_GRAPHICS before anything else happens.  I
    removed it as it would slow down accel operations.
    
    The fifo wait has been improved to avoid hitting the HW register as often,
    and the various accel ops are now performing better caching of register
    values.
    
    Overall, this improve accel performances.  The imageblit acceleration does
    result in a small overall regression in performances on some machines (on
    the order of 5% on some x86), probably becaus the SW path provides a
    better bus utilisation, but I decided to ingnore that as the performances
    is still very good, and on the other hand, some machines such as some
    sparc64 get a 3 fold performance improvement.

    cirrusfb: do not change MCLK for Alpine chips
    
    A memory clock value (MCLK) is changed to a minimum required by a current
    mode bandwidth.  This usually lowers the MCLK to its minimum (50 MHz) thus
    decreasing the card performance.  Just leave the MCLK value set by card
    BIOS.
    
    The CL-GD5446 Technical Reference Manual point 9.9.1.3 states that if a
    pixclock value is close (~1%) to the MCLK or MCLK/2 this may result in a
    jitter on the screen.  A countermeasure is to use the MCLK as pixclock
    source instead of a VCLK.  The patch implements this as well.

    intelfb: support 945GME (as used in ASUS Eee 901)
    
    Add support for Intel's 945GME graphics chip to the intelfb driver.  I
    have assumed that the 945GME is identical to the already-supported 945GM
    apart from its PCI IDs; this is based on a quick look at the X driver for
    these chips which seems to treat them identically.
    
    The 945GME is used in the ASUS Eee 901, and I coded this in the hope that
    I'd be able to use it to get a console at the native 1024x600 resolution
    which is not known to the BIOS.  I realised too late that the intelfb
    driver does not support mode changing on laptops, so it won't be any
    use for me.

    omap drivers: switch to standard GPIO calls
    
    This updates most of the OMAP drivers which are in mainline to switch to
    using the cross-platform GPIO calls instead of the older OMAP-specific
    ones.
    
    This is all fairly brainless/obvious stuff.  Probably the most interesting
    bit is to observe that the omap-keypad code seems to now have a portable
    core that could work with non-OMAP matrix keypads.  (That would improve
    with hardware IRQ debouncing enabled, of course...)

    gpiolib: gpio_to_irq() hooks
    
    Add a new gpiolib mechanism: gpio_chip instances can provide mappings
    between their (input) GPIOs and any associated IRQs.  This makes it easier
    for platforms to support IRQs that are provided by board-specific external
    chips instead of as part of their core (such as SOC-integrated GPIOs).
    
    Also update the irq_to_gpio() description, saying to avoid it because it's
    not always supported.

    gpio: i2c expanders use subsys_init
    
    Make the I2C external GPIO expander drivers register themselves at
    subsys_initcall() time when they're statically linked.
    
    SOC-integrated GPIOs are available starting very early -- early in
    arch_initcall() at latest, but often even before initcalls start to run --
    so this improves consistency, so more subsystems can rely on GPIOs in
    their own subsys_initcall() code.
    
    (This isn't a theoretical problem.  This is one of several patches needed
    to resolve oopsing observed when statically linking kernels on a DaVinci
    EVM.  Its pcf857x GPIOs needed to be available well before some other
    drivers initialized.)

    Add support for M41T65 Real Time Clock chip.
    
    The main differences I see between the M41T65 and M41T80 are that:
    
    1) The M41T65 watchdog timer has three bits controlling resolution
       (versus two for the M41T80).
    
    2) There is no register 0x13 for controlling square-wave output.

    rtc: use CONFIG_PPC instead of CONFIG_PPC_MERGE
    
    Now that arch/ppc is dead CONFIG_PPC_MERGE is always defined for all
    powerpc platforms and we want to get rid of it use CONFIG_PPC instead.

    rtc: file close() consistently disables repeating irqs
    
    Make the rtc framework consistent about disabling 1/second update IRQs
    that may have been activated through the /dev interface, when that /dev
    file is closed.  (It may have closed because of coredump, etc.) This was
    previously done only for emulated update IRQs ...  now, do it always.
    
    Also comment the current policy: repeating IRQs (periodic, update) that
    userspace enabled will be cleanly disabled, but alarms are left alone.
    Such repeating IRQs are a constant and pointless system load.
    
    Update some RTC drivers to remove now-needless release() methods.  Most
    such methods just enforce that policy.  The others all seem to be buggy,
    and mistreat in-kernel clients of periodic or alarm IRQs.

    rtc: rtc-rs5c372: add support for Ricoh R2025S/D RTC
    
    This adds support for the Ricoh R2025S/D series of I2C RTCs, produced by
    Ricoh Japan and described at:
    
    	http://www.ricoh.co.jp/LSI/product_rtc/2wire/r2025x/
    
    This series has very minor deviations from the rest of the RS5C chips,
    most of which have to do with the oscillator, which was abstracted away in
    an earlier patch.

    rtc: rtc-rs5c372: SMBus conversion/support
    
    rtc-rs5c372 presently depends on I2C master mode transfers, despite the
    fact that these RTCs frequently find themselves on SMBus-only adapters.
    
    Given that the only capabilities that were checked were for I2C_FUNC_I2C,
    it's assumed that most of the adapters that are currently using this
    driver are fairly sane, and are able to handle SMBus emulation (though we
    adjust the default capabilities to check for I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_EMUL anyways,
    which is the vast majority of them.  The adapters that don't have their
    own ->smbus_xfer() fall back on the ->master_xfer() through the emulated
    transfer).
    
    The special case is iop3xx, which has more than its fair share of hacks
    within this driver, it remains untested -- though also claims to support
    emulated SMBus accesses.  The corner case there is rs5c_get_regs() which
    uses access mode #3 for transferring the register state, while we use mode
    #1 for SMBus.

    legacy rtc: remove needless/confusing HPET_RTC_IRQ option
    
    HPET_RTC_IRQ is no longer needed; HPET_EMULATE_RTC suffices and is more
    correct.  (http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11111)
    
    Note that when using the legacy RTC driver, platforms don't really do a
    dynamic switch between HPET and non-HPET modes based on whether HPET
    hardware actually exists ...  only rtc-cmos (using the new RTC framework)
    currently switches that way.
    
    So this reflects bitrot in that legacy code, for x86/ia64: kernels with
    HPET support configured (e.g.  for a clocksource) can't get IRQs from the
    legacy RTC driver unless they really have HPET hardware.  (The obvious
    workaround is to not use the legacy RTC driver on those platforms when you
    configure HPET ...  unless you know the target really has a HPET.)

    autofs4: add miscellaneous device for ioctls
    
    Add a miscellaneous device to the autofs4 module for routing ioctls.  This
    provides the ability to obtain an ioctl file handle for an autofs mount
    point that is possibly covered by another mount.
    
    The actual problem with autofs is that it can't reconnect to existing
    mounts.  Immediately one things of just adding the ability to remount
    autofs file systems would solve it, but alas, that can't work.  This is
    because autofs direct mounts and the implementation of "on demand mount
    and expire" of nested mount trees have the file system mounted on top of
    the mount trigger dentry.
    
    To resolve this a miscellaneous device node for routing ioctl commands to
    these mount points has been implemented in the autofs4 kernel module and a
    library added to autofs.  This provides the ability to open a file
    descriptor for these over mounted autofs mount points.
    
    Please refer to Documentation/filesystems/autofs4-mount-control.txt for a
    discussion of the problem, implementation alternatives considered and a
    description of the interface.

    i2o: Fix 32/64bit DMA locking
    
    The I2O ioctls assume 32bits.  In itself that is fine as they are old
    cards and nobody uses 64bit.  However on LKML it was noted this
    assumption is also made for allocated memory and is unsafe on 64bit
    systems.
    
    Fixing this is a mess.  It turns out there is tons of crap buried in a
    header file that does racy 32/64bit filtering on the masks.
    
    So we:
    - Verify all callers of the racy code can sleep (i2o_dma_[re]alloc)
    - Move the code into a new i2o/memory.c file
    - Remove the gfp_mask argument so nobody can try and misuse the function
    - Wrap a mutex around the problem area (a single mutex is easy to do and
      none of this is performance relevant)
    - Switch the remaining problem kmalloc holdout to use i2o_dma_alloc

    Allow recursion in binfmt_script and binfmt_misc
    
    binfmt_script and binfmt_misc disallow recursion to avoid stack overflow
    using sh_bang and misc_bang.  It causes problem in some cases:
    
    $ echo '#!/bin/ls' > /tmp/t0
    $ echo '#!/tmp/t0' > /tmp/t1
    $ echo '#!/tmp/t1' > /tmp/t2
    $ chmod +x /tmp/t*
    $ /tmp/t2
    zsh: exec format error: /tmp/t2
    
    Similar problem with binfmt_misc.
    
    This patch introduces field 'recursion_depth' into struct linux_binprm to
    track recursion level in binfmt_misc and binfmt_script.  If recursion
    level more then BINPRM_MAX_RECURSION it generates -ENOEXEC.

    alpha: introduce field 'taso' into struct linux_binprm
    
    This change is Alpha-specific.  It adds field 'taso' into struct
    linux_binprm to remember if the application is TASO.  Previously, field
    sh_bang was used for this purpose.

    This series of patches re-introduces the iommu_num_pages function so that
    it can be used by each architecture specific IOMMU implementations.  The
    series also changes IOMMU implementations for X86, Alpha, PowerPC and
    UltraSparc.  The other implementations are not yet changed because the
    modifications required are not obvious and I can't test them on real
    hardware.

    compat: move cp_compat_stat to common code
    
    struct stat / compat_stat is the same on all architectures, so
    cp_compat_stat should be, too.
    
    Turns out it is, except that various architectures have slightly and some
    high2lowuid/high2lowgid or the direct assignment instead of the
    SET_UID/SET_GID that expands to the correct one anyway.
    
    This patch replaces the arch-specific cp_compat_stat implementations with
    a common one based on the x86-64 one.

    kernel/kallsyms.c: fix double return
    
    Commit 6dd06c9fbe025f542bce4cdb91790c0f91962722 ("module: make
    module_address_lookup safe") introduced double returns in the function
    kallsyms_lookup(), it's weird.  The second one should be removed.

    epoll: drop unnecessary test
    
    Thomas found that there is an unnecessary (always true) test in
    ep_send_events().  The callback never inserts into ->rdllink while the
    send loop is performed, and also does the ~EP_PRIVATE_BITS test.  Given
    we're holding the mutex during this time, the conditions tested inside the
    loop are always true.  This patch drops the test done inside the
    re-insertion loop.

    Only three of Atmel's AT91 processors (SAM9263, SAM9RL and CAP9) include a

    It should therefore only be possible to enable the misc/atmel_pwm.c driver

    exec.c, compat.c: fix count(), compat_count() bounds checking
    
    With MAX_ARG_STRINGS set to 0x7FFFFFFF, and being passed to 'count()' and
    compat_count(), it would appear that the current max bounds check of
    fs/exec.c:394:
    
    	if(++i > max)
    		return -E2BIG;
    
    would never trigger. Since 'i' is of type int, so values would wrap and the
    function would continue looping.
    
    Simple fix seems to be chaning ++i to i++ and checking for '>='.

    utsname: completely overwrite prior information
    
    On sethostname() and setdomainname(), previous information may be retained
    if it was longer than than the new hostname/domainname.
    
    This can be demonstrated trivially by calling sethostname() first with a
    long name, then with a short name, and then calling uname() to retrieve
    the full buffer that contains the hostname (and possibly parts of the old
    hostname), one just has to look past the terminating zero.
    
    I don't know if we should really care that much (hence the RFC); the only
    scenarios I can possibly think of is administrator putting something
    sensitive in the hostname (or domain name) by accident, and changing it
    back will not undo the mistake entirely, though it's not like we can
    recover gracefully from "rm -rf /" either...  The other scenario is
    namespaces (CLONE_NEWUTS) where some information may be unintentionally
    "inherited" from the previous namespace (a program wants to hide the
    original name and does clone + sethostname, but some information is still
    left).
    
    I think the patch may be defended on grounds of the principle of least
    surprise.  But I am not adamant :-)
    
    (I guess the question now is whether userspace should be able to
    write embedded NULs into the buffer or not...)
    
    At least the observation has been made and the patch has been presented.

    profiling: dynamically enable readprofile at runtime
    
    Way too often, I have a machine that exhibits some kind of crappy
    behavior.  The CPU looks wedged in the kernel or it is spending way too
    much system time and I wonder what is responsible.
    
    I try to run readprofile.  But, of course, Ubuntu doesn't enable it by
    default.  Dang!
    
    The reason we boot-time enable it is that it takes a big bufffer that we
    generally can only bootmem alloc.  But, does it hurt to at least try and
    runtime-alloc it?
    
    To use:
    echo 2 > /sys/kernel/profile
    
    Then run readprofile like normal.
    
    This should fix the compile issue with allmodconfig.  I've compile-tested
    on a bunch more configs now including a few more architectures.

    rlimit: permit setting RLIMIT_NOFILE to RLIM_INFINITY
    
    When a process wants to set the limit of open files to RLIM_INFINITY it
    gets EPERM even if it has CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability.
    
    For example, BIND does:
    
    ...
    #elif defined(NR_OPEN) && defined(__linux__)
            /*
             * Some Linux kernels don't accept RLIM_INFINIT; the maximum
             * possible value is the NR_OPEN defined in linux/fs.h.
             */
            if (resource == isc_resource_openfiles && rlim_value == RLIM_INFINITY) {
                    rl.rlim_cur = rl.rlim_max = NR_OPEN;
                    unixresult = setrlimit(unixresource, &rl);
                    if (unixresult == 0)
                            return (ISC_R_SUCCESS);
            }
    #elif ...
    
    If we allow setting RLIMIT_NOFILE to RLIM_INFINITY we increase portability
    - you don't have to check if OS is linux and then use different schema for
    limits.
    
    The spec says "Specifying RLIM_INFINITY as any resource limit value on a
    successful call to setrlimit() shall inhibit enforcement of that resource
    limit." and we're presently not doing that.

    Make the taint flags reliable
    
    It's somewhat unlikely that it happens, but right now a race window
    between interrupts or machine checks or oopses could corrupt the tainted
    bitmap because it is modified in a non atomic fashion.
    
    Convert the taint variable to an unsigned long and use only atomic bit
    operations on it.
    
    Unfortunately this means the intvec sysctl functions cannot be used on it
    anymore.
    
    It turned out the taint sysctl handler could actually be simplified a bit
    (since it only increases capabilities) so this patch actually removes
    code.

    initramfs: add option to preserve mtime from initramfs cpio images
    
    When unpacking the cpio into the initramfs, mtimes are not preserved by
    default.  This patch adds an INITRAMFS_PRESERVE_MTIME option that allows
    mtimes stored in the cpio image to be used when constructing the
    initramfs.
    
    For embedded applications that run exclusively out of the initramfs, this
    is invaluable:
    
    When building embedded application initramfs images, its nice to know when
    the files were actually created during the build process - that makes it
    easier to see what files were modified when so we can compare the files
    that are being used on the image with the files used during the build
    process.  This might help (for example) to determine if the target system
    has all the updated files you expect to see w/o having to check MD5s etc.
    
    In our environment, the whole system runs off the initramfs partition, and
    seeing the modified times of the shared libraries (for example) helps us
    find bugs that may have been introduced by the build system incorrectly
    propogating outdated shared libraries into the image.
    
    Similarly, many of the initializion/configuration files in /etc might be
    dynamically built by the build system, and knowing when they were modified
    helps us sanity check whether the target system has the "latest" files
    etc.
    
    Finally, we might use last modified times to determine whether a hot fix
    should be applied or not to the running ramfs.

    wait: kill is_sync_wait()
    
    is_sync_wait() is used to distinguish between sync and async waits.
    Basically sync waits are the ones initialized with init_waitqueue_entry()
    and async ones with init_waitqueue_func_entry().  The sync/async
    distinction is used only in prepare_to_wait[_exclusive]() and its only
    function is to skip setting the current task state if the wait is async.
    This has a few problems.
    
    * No one uses it.  None of func_entry users use prepare_to_wait()
      functions, so the code path never gets executed.
    
    * The distinction is bogus.  Maybe back when func_entry is used only
      by aio but it's now also used by epoll and in future possibly by 9p
      and poll/select.
    
    * Taking @state as argument and ignoring it silenly depending on how
      @wait is initialized is just a bad error-prone API.
    
    * It prevents func_entry waits from using wait->private for no good
      reason.
    
    This patch kills is_sync_wait() and the associated code paths from
    prepare_to_wait[_exclusive]().  As there was no user of these code paths,
    this patch doesn't cause any behavior difference.

    vsprintf: use new vsprintf symbolic function pointer format
    
    Use the '%pF' format to get rid of an "#ifdef DEBUG" and make some printks
    atomic.
    
    This removes the last in-tree uses of print_fn_descriptor_symbol().  I
    marked print_fn_descriptor_symbol() deprecated and scheduled it for
    removal next year to give time for out-of-tree modules to be updated.
    
    parisc's print_fn_descriptor_symbol() is currently broken there (it needs
    to dereference the function pointer similar to ia64 and power).  This
    patch shouldn't make anything worse, but it means we need to fix
    dereference_function_descriptor() instead of print_fn_descriptor_symbol()
    to get meaningful initcall_debug output.

    identify_ramdisk_image() returns 0 (not -1) if a gzipped ramdisk is found:
    
    	if (buf[0] == 037 && ((buf[1] == 0213) || (buf[1] == 0236))) {
    		printk(KERN_NOTICE
    		       "RAMDISK: Compressed image found at block %d\n",
    		       start_block);
    		nblocks = 0;
    		^^^^^^^^^^^
    		goto done;
    	}
    
    	...
    
    done:
    	sys_lseek(fd, start_block * BLOCK_SIZE, 0);
    	kfree(buf);
    	return nblocks;
    	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    
    Hence correct the typo in the comment, which has existed since the
    addition of compressed ramdisk support in 1.3.48.

    pm: rework disabling of user mode helpers during suspend/hibernation
    
    We currently use a PM notifier to disable user mode helpers before suspend
    and hibernation and to re-enable them during resume.  However, this is not
    an ideal solution, because if any drivers want to upload firmware into
    memory before suspend, they have to use a PM notifier for this purpose and
    there is no guarantee that the ordering of PM notifiers will be as
    expected (ie.  the notifier that disables user mode helpers has to be run
    after the driver's notifier used for uploading the firmware).
    
    For this reason, it seems better to move the disabling and enabling of
    user mode helpers to separate functions that will be called by the PM core
    as necessary.

    uclinux: fix gzip header parsing in binfmt_flat.c
    
    There are off-by-one errors in decompress_exec() when calculating the length of
    optional "original file name" and "comment" fields: the "ret" index is not
    incremented when terminating '\0' character is reached. The check of the buffer
    overflow (after an "extra-field" length was taken into account) is also fixed.
    
    I've encountered this off-by-one error when tried to reuse
    gzip-header-parsing part of the decompress_exec() function.  There was an
    "original file name" field in the payload (with miscalculated length) and
    zlib_inflate() returned Z_DATA_ERROR.  But after the fix similar to this
    one all worked fine.

    hugetlb: handle updating of ACCESSED and DIRTY in hugetlb_fault()
    
    The page fault path for normal pages, if the fault is neither a no-page
    fault nor a write-protect fault, will update the DIRTY and ACCESSED bits
    in the page table appropriately.
    
    The hugepage fault path, however, does not do this, handling only no-page
    or write-protect type faults.  It assumes that either the ACCESSED and
    DIRTY bits are irrelevant for hugepages (usually true, since they are
    never swapped) or that they are handled by the arch code.
    
    This is inconvenient for some software-loaded TLB architectures, where the
    _PAGE_ACCESSED (_PAGE_DIRTY) bits need to be set to enable read (write)
    access to the page at the TLB miss.  This could be worked around in the
    arch TLB miss code, but the TLB miss fast path can be made simple more
    easily if the hugetlb_fault() path handles this, as the normal page fault
    path does.

    introduce generic header file for the software IO/TLB
    
    A series of patches introduce a generic header file for the software
    IO/TLB implementation in lib/swiotlb.c.  Currently each architecture using
    this code defines the prototypes itself.  The prototypes are moved to
    include/linux/swiotlb.h and this file is included in architecture specific
    code for X86 and IA64.
    
    This patch:
    
    Create include/linux/swiotlb.h file which contains all function prototypes
    for the lib/swiotlb.c file.
    
    (akpm: the dependent patches will be trickled through arch trees)

    UIO: Fix mapping of logical and virtual memory
    
    mmap() doesn't work as expected for UIO_MEM_LOGICAL or UIO_MEM_VIRTUAL
    mappings. The offset into the memory needs to be added, otherwise
    uio_vma_fault always returns the first page only. Note that for UIO
    userspace calls mmap() with offset = N * getpagesize() to access
    mapping N. This must be compensated when calculating the offset. A
    comment was added to explain this since it is not obvious.

    UIO: add automata sercos3 pci card support
    
    Here is a new version of the patch to support the Automata Sercos III
    PCI card driver. I now check that the IRQ is enabled before accepting
    the interrupt.
    
    I still use a logical OR to store the enabled interrupts and I've
    added a second use of a logical OR when restoring the enabled
    interrupts. I added an explanation of why I do this in comments at the
    top of the source file.
    
    Since I use a logical OR, I also removed the extra checks if the
    Interrupt Enable Register and ier0_cache are 0.

    kobject: Fix kobject_rename and !CONFIG_SYSFS
    
    When looking at kobject_rename I found two bugs with
    that exist when sysfs support is disabled in the kernel.
    
    kobject_rename does not change the name on the kobject when
    sysfs support is not compiled in.
    
    kobject_rename without locking attempts to check the
    validity of a rename operation, which the kobject layer
    simply does not have the infrastructure to do.
    
    This patch documents the previously unstated requirement of
    kobject_rename that is the responsibility of the caller to
    provide mutual exclusion and to be certain that the new_name
    for the kobject is valid.
    
    This patch modifies sysfs_rename_dir in !CONFIG_SYSFS case
    to call kobject_set_name to actually change the kobject_name.
    
    This patch removes the bogus and misleading check in kobject_rename
    that attempts to see if a rename is valid.  The check is bogus
    because we do not have the proper locking.  The check is misleading
    because it looks like we can and do perform checking at the kobject
    level that we don't.

    As inode creation is protected by sysfs_mutex, ilookup5_nowait()
    always either fails to find at all or finds one which is fully

    Yes, it is a real bug by the looks. bin.c takes bb->mutex under mmap_sem
    when it is mmapped, and then does its copy_*_user under bb->mutex too.
    
    Here is a basic fix for the sysfs lor.

    device model: Do a quickcheck for driver binding before doing an expensive check
    
    This patch adds a quick check for the driver<->device match before
    taking the locks and doin gthe expensive checks. Taking the lock hurts
    in asynchronous boot context where the device lock gets hit; one of the
    init functions takes the lock and goes to do an expensive hardware init;
    the other init functions walk the same PCI list and get stuck on the
    lock as a result.
    
    For the common case, we can know there's no chance whatsoever of a match
    if the device isn't in the drivers ID table... so this patch does that
    check as a best-effort-avoid-the-lock approach.

    Note the long time "agp_ali_init" takes in the first graph; my laptop
    doesn't even have an ALI chip in it!  (the bootgraphs look a bit
    dissimilar, but that's the point, the first one has a bunch of arbitrary
    delays in it that cause it to look very different)
    
    This reduces my kernel boot time by about 20%

    Driver core: Fix cleanup in device_create_vargs().
    
    If device_register() in device_create_vargs() fails, the device

    sysfs: Support sysfs_notify from atomic context with new sysfs_notify_dirent
    
    Support sysfs_notify from atomic context with new sysfs_notify_dirent
    
    sysfs_notify currently takes sysfs_mutex.
    This means that it cannot be called in atomic context.
    sysfs_mutex  is sometimes held over a malloc (sysfs_rename_dir)
    so it can block on low memory.
    
    In md I want to be able to notify on a sysfs attribute from
    atomic context, and I don't want to block on low memory because I
    could be in the writeout path for freeing memory.
    
    So:
     - export the "sysfs_dirent" structure along with sysfs_get, sysfs_put
       and sysfs_get_dirent so I can get the sysfs_dirent that I want to
       notify on and hold it in an md structure.
     - split sysfs_notify_dirent out of sysfs_notify so the sysfs_dirent
       can be notified on with no blocking (just a spinlock).

commit 346e15beb5343c2eb8216d820f2ed8f150822b08
Author: Jason Baron <jbaron@redhat.com>

    driver core: basic infrastructure for per-module dynamic debug messages
    
    Base infrastructure to enable per-module debug messages.
    
    I've introduced CONFIG_DYNAMIC_PRINTK_DEBUG, which when enabled centralizes
    control of debugging statements on a per-module basis in one /proc file,
    currently, <debugfs>/dynamic_printk/modules. When, CONFIG_DYNAMIC_PRINTK_DEBUG,
    is not set, debugging statements can still be enabled as before, often by
    defining 'DEBUG' for the proper compilation unit. Thus, this patch set has no
    affect when CONFIG_DYNAMIC_PRINTK_DEBUG is not set.
    
    The infrastructure currently ties into all pr_debug() and dev_dbg() calls. That
    is, if CONFIG_DYNAMIC_PRINTK_DEBUG is set, all pr_debug() and dev_dbg() calls
    can be dynamically enabled/disabled on a per-module basis.
    
    Future plans include extending this functionality to subsystems, that define
    their own debug levels and flags.
    
    Usage:
    
    Dynamic debugging is controlled by the debugfs file,
    <debugfs>/dynamic_printk/modules. This file contains a list of the modules that
    can be enabled. The format of the file is as follows:
    
    	<module_name> <enabled=0/1>
    		.
    		.
    		.
    
    	<module_name> : Name of the module in which the debug call resides
    	<enabled=0/1> : whether the messages are enabled or not
    
    For example:
    
    	snd_hda_intel enabled=0
    	fixup enabled=1
    	driver enabled=0
    
    Enable a module:
    
    	$echo "set enabled=1 <module_name>" > dynamic_printk/modules
    
    Disable a module:
    
    	$echo "set enabled=0 <module_name>" > dynamic_printk/modules
    
    Enable all modules:
    
    	$echo "set enabled=1 all" > dynamic_printk/modules
    
    Disable all modules:
    
    	$echo "set enabled=0 all" > dynamic_printk/modules
    
    Finally, passing "dynamic_printk" at the command line enables
    debugging for all modules. This mode can be turned off via the above
    disable command.

    agp: Fix stolen memory counting on G4X.
    
    On the GM45, the amount of stolen memory mapped to the GTT was underestimated,
    even though we had 508KB more available since the GTT doesn't take from
    stolen memory. On the non-GM45 G4X, we overestimated how much stolen was
    mapped to the GTT by 4KB, resulting in GPU page faults when that page was
    accessed.

    IPV6: Fix default gateway criteria wrt. HIGH/LOW preference radv option
    
    Problem observed:
                   In IPv6, in the presence of multiple routers candidates to
                   default gateway in one segment, each sending a different
                   value of preference, the Linux hosts connected to the
                   segment weren't selecting the right one in all the
                   combinations possible of LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH preference.
    
    This patch changes two files:
    include/linux/icmpv6.h
                   Get the "router_pref" bitfield in the right place
                   (as RFC4191 says), named the bit left with this fix as
                   "home_agent" (RFC3775 say that's his function)
    
    net/ipv6/ndisc.c
                   Corrects the binary logic behind the updating of the
                   router preference in the flags of the routing table
    
    Result:
                   With this two fixes applied, the default route used by
                   the system was to consistent with the rules mentioned
                   in RFC4191 in case of changes in the value of preference
                   in router advertisements

    firewire: fw-sbp2: fix another small generation access bug
    
    queuecommand() looked at the remote and local node IDs before it read
    the bus generation.  The corresponding race with sbp2_reconnect updating
    these data was probably impossible to happen though because the current
    code blocks the SCSI layer during reconnection.  However, better safe
    than sorry, especially if someone later improves the code to not block
    the SCSI layer.

    firewire: fw-sbp2: enforce s/g segment size limit
    
    1. We don't need to round the SBP-2 segment size limit down to a
       multiple of 4 kB (0xffff -> 0xf000).  It is only necessary to
       ensure quadlet alignment (0xffff -> 0xfffc).
    
    2. Use dma_set_max_seg_size() to tell the DMA mapping infrastructure
       and the block IO layer about the restriction.  This way we can
       remove the size checks and segment splitting in the queuecommand
       path.
    
       This assumes that no other code in the firewire stack uses
       dma_map_sg() with conflicting requirements.  It furthermore assumes
       that the controller device's platform actually allows us to set the
       segment size to our liking.  Assert the latter with a BUG_ON().
    
    3. Also use blk_queue_max_segment_size() to tell the block IO layer
       about it.  It cannot know it because our scsi_add_host() does not
       point to the FireWire controller's device.

    ieee1394: survive a few seconds connection loss
    
    There are situations when nodes vanish from the bus and come back in
    quickly thereafter:
      - When certain bus-powered hubs are plugged in,
      - when certain disk enclosures are switched from self-power to bus
        power or vice versa and break the daisy chain during the transition,
      - when the user plugs a cable out and quickly plugs it back in, e.g.
        to reorder a daisy chain (works on Mac OS X if done quickly enough),
      - when certain hubs temporarily malfunction during high bus traffic.
    
    The ieee1394 driver's nodemgr already contained a function to set
    vanished nodes aside into "limbo"; i.e. they wouldn't actually be
    deleted right away.  (In fact, only unloading the driver or writing into
    an obscure sysfs attribute would delete them eventually.)  If nodes
    reappeared later, they would be resurrected out of limbo.
    
    Moving nodes into and out of limbo was accompanied with calling the
    .suspend() and .resume() driver methods of the drivers which were bound
    to a respective node's unit directories.  Not only is this somewhat
    strange due to the intended use of these driver methods for power
    management, also the sbp2 driver in particular does not implement
    .suspend() and .resume().  Hence sbp2 would be disconnected from devices
    in situations as listed above.
    
    We now:
      - leave drivers bound when nodes go into limbo,
      - call the drivers' .update() when nodes come out of limbo,
      - automatically delete in-limbo nodes 3 seconds after the last
        bus reset and bus rescan.
      - Because of the automatic removal, the now obsolete bus attribute
        /sys/bus/ieee1394/destroy_node is removed.
    
    This especially lets sbp2 survive brief disconnections.  You can for
    example yank a disk's cable and plug it back in while reading the
    respective disk with dd, but dd will happily continue as if nothing
    happened.

    ieee1394: raw1394: make write() thread-safe
    
    Application programs should use a libraw1394 handle only in a single
    thread.  The raw1394 driver was apparently relying on this, because it
    did nothing to protect its fi->state variable from corruption due to
    concurrent accesses.
    
    We now serialize the fi->state accesses.  This affects the write() path.
    We re-use the state_mutex which was introduced to protect fi->iso_state
    accesses in the ioctl() path.  These paths and accesses are independent
    of each other, hence separate mutexes could be used.  But I don't see
    much benefit in that.

    ieee1394: raw1394: narrow down the state_mutex protected region
    
    Refactor the ioctl dispatcher in order to move a fraction of it out of
    the section which is serialized by fi->state_mutex.  This is not so much
    about performance but more about self-documentation:  The mutex_lock()/
    mutex_unlock() calls are now closer to the data accesses which the mutex
    protects, i.e. to the iso_state switch.

    ieee1394: raw1394: replace BKL by local mutex, make ioctl() and mmap() thread-safe
    
    This removes the last usage of the Big Kernel Lock from the ieee1394
    stack, i.e. from raw1394's (unlocked_)ioctl and compat_ioctl.
    
    The ioctl()s don't need to take the BKL, but they need to be serialized
    per struct file *.  In particular, accesses to ->iso_state need to be
    serial.  We simply use a blocking mutex for this purpose because
    libraw1394 does not use O_NONBLOCK.  In practice, there is no lock
    contention anyway because most if not all libraw1394 clients use a
    libraw1394 handle only in a single thread.
    
    mmap() also accesses ->iso_state.  Until now this was unprotected
    against concurrent changes by ioctls.  Fix this bug while we are at it.

    ieee1394: sbp2: enforce s/g segment size limit
    
    1. We don't need to round the SBP-2 segment size limit down to a
       multiple of 4 kB (0xffff -> 0xf000).  It is only necessary to
       ensure quadlet alignment (0xffff -> 0xfffc).
    
    2. Use dma_set_max_seg_size() to tell the DMA mapping infrastructure
       and the block IO layer about the restriction.  This way we can
       remove the size checks and segment splitting in the queuecommand
       path.
    
       This assumes that no other code in the ieee1394 stack uses
       dma_map_sg() with conflicting requirements.  It furthermore assumes
       that the controller device's platform actually allows us to set the
       segment size to our liking.  Assert the latter with a BUG_ON().
    
    3. Also use blk_queue_max_segment_size() to tell the block IO layer
       about it.  It cannot know it because our scsi_add_host() does not
       point to the FireWire controller's device.
    
    We can also uniformly use dma_map_sg() for the single segment case just
    like for the multi segment case, to further simplify the code.
    
    Also clean up how the page table is converted to big endian.
    
    Thanks to Grant Grundler and FUJITA Tomonori for advice.

    Two dma_sync_single_for_cpu() were called in the wrong place.
    Luckily they were merely for DMA_TO_DEVICE, hence nobody noticed.
    
    Also reorder the matching dma_sync_single_for_device() a little bit
    so that they reside in the same functions as their counterparts.
    This also avoids syncing the s/g table for requests which don't use it.

    When we skip unrecognized options in xfs_fs_remount we should just break
    out of the switch and not return because otherwise we may skip clearing
    the xfs-internal read-only flag.  This will only show up on some
    operations like touch because most read-only checks are done by the VFS
    which thinks this filesystem is r/w.  Eventually we should replace the
    XFS read-only flag with a helper that always checks the VFS flag to make
    sure they can never get out of sync.

    KVM: PIC: enhance IPI avoidance
    
    The PIC code makes little effort to avoid kvm_vcpu_kick(), resulting in
    unnecessary guest exits in some conditions.
    
    For example, if the timer interrupt is routed through the IOAPIC, IRR
    for IRQ 0 will get set but not cleared, since the APIC is handling the
    acks.
    
    This means that everytime an interrupt < 16 is triggered, the priority
    logic will find IRQ0 pending and send an IPI to vcpu0 (in case IRQ0 is
    not masked, which is Linux's case).
    
    Introduce a new variable isr_ack to represent the IRQ's for which the
    guest has been signalled / cleared the ISR. Use it to avoid more than
    one IPI per trigger-ack cycle, in addition to the avoidance when ISR is
    set in get_priority().

    KVM: MMU: out of sync shadow core
    
    Allow guest pagetables to go out of sync.  Instead of emulating write
    accesses to guest pagetables, or unshadowing them, we un-write-protect
    the page table and allow the guest to modify it at will.  We rely on
    invlpg executions to synchronize individual ptes, and will synchronize
    the entire pagetable on tlb flushes.

    One of vcpu_setup responsibilities is to do mmu initialization.
    However, in case we fail in kvm_arch_vcpu_reset, before we get the
    chance to init mmu. OTOH, vcpu_destroy will attempt to destroy mmu,
    triggering a bug. Keeping track of whether or not mmu is initialized
    would unnecessarily complicate things. Rather, we just make return,
    making sure any needed uninitialization is done before we return, in
    case we fail.

    [ARM] 5308/1: Fix Viper ISA IRQ handling
    
    The ISA IRQ renumbering broke the Viper ISA code in interesting ways.
    It originally assumed that ISA interrupt were numbered in the order that
    is defined by the CPLD registers. Unfortunately, this is no longer the
    case.
    
    Furthermore, the viper_irq_handler() function being a chained IRQ
    handler, it must ACK the interrupt by itself, or the handler will be
    immediately reentered, with the expected damages.
    
    This fix was made possible thanks to the help of David Raeman, who
    provided debug information and tested each version of this patch.

    Add DstAcc operand type. That means that there are 4 bits now for

    "In the good old days cpus would have only one register that was able to
     fully participate in arithmetic operations, typically called A for
     Accumulator.  The x86 retains this tradition by having special, shorter
     encodings for the A register (like the cmp opcode), and even some
     instructions that only operate on A (like mul).
    
     SrcAcc and DstAcc would accommodate these instructions by decoding A
     into the corresponding 'struct operand'."

    Fix by turning the bit on in the spte and changing it to use the portable
    accessed mask.

    KVM: MMU: Add generic shadow walker
    
    We currently walk the shadow page tables in two places: direct map (for
    real mode and two dimensional paging) and paging mode shadow.  Since we
    anticipate requiring a third walk (for invlpg), it makes sense to have
    a generic facility for shadow walk.
    
    This patch adds such a shadow walker, walks the page tables and calls a
    method for every spte encountered.  The method can examine the spte,
    modify it, or even instantiate it.  The walk can be aborted by returning
    nonzero from the method.

    KVM: fix i8259 reset irq acking
    
    The irq ack during pic reset has three problems:
    
    - Ignores slave/master PIC, using gsi 0-8 for both.
    - Generates an ACK even if the APIC is in control.
    - Depends upon IMR being clear, which is broken if the irq was masked
    at the time it was generated.
    
    The last one causes the BIOS to hang after the first reboot of
    Windows installation, since PIT interrupts stop.

    KVM: Reduce kvm stack usage in kvm_arch_vm_ioctl()
    
    On my machine with gcc 3.4, kvm uses ~2k of stack in a few
    select functions.  This is mostly because gcc fails to
    notice that the different case: statements could have their
    stack usage combined.  It overflows very nicely if interrupts
    happen during one of these large uses.
    
    This patch uses two methods for reducing stack usage.
    1. dynamically allocate large objects instead of putting
       on the stack.
    2. Use a union{} member for all of the case variables. This
       tricks gcc into combining them all into a single stack
       allocation. (There's also a comment on this)

    KVM: pci device assignment
    
    Based on a patch from: Amit Shah <amit.shah@qumranet.com>
    
    This patch adds support for handling PCI devices that are assigned to
    the guest.
    
    The device to be assigned to the guest is registered in the host kernel
    and interrupt delivery is handled.  If a device is already assigned, or
    the device driver for it is still loaded on the host, the device
    assignment is failed by conveying a -EBUSY reply to the userspace.
    
    Devices that share their interrupt line are not supported at the moment.
    
    By itself, this patch will not make devices work within the guest.
    The VT-d extension is required to enable the device to perform DMA.
    Another alternative is PVDMA.

    x86: KVM guest: use paravirt function to calculate cpu khz
    
    We're currently facing timing problems in guests that do
    calibration under heavy load, and then the load vanishes.
    This means we'll have a much lower lpj than we actually should,
    and delays end up taking less time than they should, which is a
    nasty bug.
    
    Solution is to pass on the lpj value from host to guest, and have it
    preset.

    KVM: PIT: fix injection logic and count
    
    The PIT injection logic is problematic under the following cases:
    
    1) If there is a higher priority vector to be delivered by the time
    kvm_pit_timer_intr_post is invoked ps->inject_pending won't be set.
    This opens the possibility for missing many PIT event injections (say if
    guest executes hlt at this point).
    
    2) ps->inject_pending is racy with more than two vcpus. Since there's no locking
    around read/dec of pt->pending, two vcpu's can inject two interrupts for a single
    pt->pending count.
    
    Fix 1 by using an irq ack notifier: only reinject when the previous irq
    has been acked. Fix 2 with appropriate locking around manipulation of
    pending count and irq_ack by the injection / ack paths.

    KVM: powerpc: Map guest userspace with TID=0 mappings
    
    When we use TID=N userspace mappings, we must ensure that kernel mappings have
    been destroyed when entering userspace. Using TID=1/TID=0 for kernel/user
    mappings and running userspace with PID=0 means that userspace can't access the
    kernel mappings, but the kernel can directly access userspace.
    
    The net is that we don't need to flush the TLB on privilege switches, but we do
    on guest context switches (which are far more infrequent). Guest boot time
    performance improvement: about 30%.

    KVM: VMX: Reinject real mode exception
    
    As we execute real mode guests in VM86 mode, exception have to be
    reinjected appropriately when the guest triggered them. For this purpose
    the patch adopts the real-mode injection pattern used in vmx_inject_irq
    to vmx_queue_exception, additionally taking care that the IP is set
    correctly for #BP exceptions. Furthermore it extends
    handle_rmode_exception to reinject all those exceptions that can be
    raised in real mode.
    
    This fixes the execution of himem.exe from FreeDOS and also makes its
    debug.com work properly.
    
    Note that guest debugging in real mode is broken now. This has to be
    fixed by the scheduled debugging infrastructure rework (will be done
    once base patches for QEMU have been accepted).

    ath9k/mac80211: disallow fragmentation in ath9k, report to userspace
    
    As I've reported, ath9k currently fails utterly when fragmentation
    is enabled. This makes ath9k "support" hardware fragmentation by
    not supporting fragmentation at all to avoid the double-free issue.
    The patch also changes mac80211 to report errors from the driver
    operation to userspace.
    
    That hack in ath9k should be removed once the rate control algorithm
    it has is fixed, and we can at that time consider removing the hw
    fragmentation support entirely since it's not used by any driver.

    rtc-cmos: look for PNP RTC first, then for platform RTC
    
    We shouldn't rely on "pnp_platform_devices" to tell us whether there
    is a PNP RTC device.
    
    I introduced "pnp_platform_devices", but I think it was a mistake.
    All it tells us is whether we found any PNPBIOS or PNPACPI devices.
    Many machines have some PNP devices, but do not describe the RTC
    via PNP.  On those machines, we need to do the platform driver probe
    to find the RTC.
    
    We should just register the PNP driver and see whether it claims anything.
    If we don't find a PNP RTC, fall back to the platform driver probe.
    
    This (in conjunction with the arch/x86/kernel/rtc.c patch to add
    a platform RTC device when PNP doesn't have one) should resolve
    these issues:

    x86: register a platform RTC device if PNP doesn't describe it
    
    Most if not all x86 platforms have an RTC device, but sometimes the RTC
    is not exposed as a PNP0b00/PNP0b01/PNP0b02 device in PNPBIOS or ACPI:
    
        http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11580
        https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=451188
    
    It's best if we can discover the RTC via PNP because then we know
    which flavor of device it is, where it lives, and which IRQ it uses.
    
    But if we can't, we should register a platform device using the

    NFS: Fix a resolution problem with nfs_inode->cache_change_attribute
    
    The cache_change_attribute is used to decide whether or not a directory has
    changed, in which case we may need to look it up again. Again, the use of
    'jiffies' leads to an issue of resolution.
    
    Once again, the fix is to change nfs_inode->cache_change_attribute, and
    just make it a simple counter.

    NFS: Fix the resolution problem with nfs_inode_attrs_need_update()
    
    It appears that 'jiffies' timestamps do not have high enough resolution for
    nfs_inode_attrs_need_update(). One problem is that a GETATTR can be
    launched within < 1 jiffy of the last operation that updated the attribute.
    Another problem is that RPC calls can take < 1 jiffy to execute.
    
    We can fix this by switching the variables to use a simple global counter
    that gets incremented every time we start another GETATTR call.

    powerpc: Fix CHRP PCI config access for indirect_pci
    
    Recently, indirect_pci was changed to test if the bus number requested
    is the one hanging straight off the PHB, then it substitutes the bus
    number with another one contained in a new "self_busno" field of the
    pci_controller structure.
    
    However, this breaks CHRP which didn't initialize this new field, and
    which relies on having the right bus number passed to the hardware.
    
    This fixes it by initializing this variable properly for all CHRP bridges

    powerpc/chrp: Fix detection of Python PCI host bridge on IBM CHRPs
    
    The detection of the IBM "Python" PCI host bridge on IBM CHRP
    machines such as old RS6000 was broken when we changed
    of_device_is_compatible() from strncasecmp to strcasecmp (dropped
    the "n" variant) due to the way IBM encodes the chip version.
    
    We fix that by instead doing a match on the model property like
    we do for others bridges in that file. It should be good enough
    for those machines. If yours is still broken, let me know.

    powerpc/pci: Improve detection of unassigned bridge resources
    
    When the powerpc PCI layer is not configured to re-assign everything,
    it currently fails to detect that a PCI to PCI bridge has been left
    unassigned by the firmware and tries to allocate resource for the
    default window values in the bridge (0...X) (with the notable exception
    of a hack we have in there that detects some Apple firmware unassigned
    bridge resources).
    
    This results in resource allocation failures, which are generally
    fixed up later on but it causes scary warnings in the logs and we
    have seen the fixup code fall over in some circumstances (a different
    issue to fix as well).
    
    This code improves that by providing a more complete & useful function
    to intuit that a bridge was left unassigned by the firmware, and thus
    force a full re-allocation by the PCI code without trying to allocate
    the existing useless resources first.
    
    The algorithm we use basically considers unassigned a window that
    starts at 0 (PCI address) if the corresponding address space enable
    bit is not set. In addition, for memory space, it considers such a
    resource unassigned also if the host bridge isn't configured to
    forward cycles to address 0 (ie, the resource basically overlaps
    main memory).
    
    This fixes a range of problems with things like Bare-Metal support
    on pSeries machines, or attempt to use partial firmware PCI setup.

    HID: fix a lockup regression when using force feedback on a PID device
    
    Commit 8006479c9b75fb6594a7b746af3d7f1fbb68f18f introduced a spinlock in
    input_dev->event_lock, which is locked when handling input events.
    However, the hid-pidff driver sleeps when handling events as it waits for
    reports being sent to the device before changing the report contents
    again.
    This causes a system lockup when trying to use force feedback with a PID
    device, a regression introduced in 2.6.24 and 2.6.23.15.
    
    Fix it by extracting the raw report data from struct hid_report
    immediately when hid_submit_report() is called, therefore allowing
    drivers to change the contents of struct hid_report immediately without
    affecting the already-queued transfer.
    
    In hid-pidff, re-add the removed usbhid_wait_io() to
    pidff_erase_effect() instead, to prevent a full report queue from causing
    the submission to fail, thus not freeing up device memory.
    pidff_erase_effect() is not called while dev->event_lock is held.

    This seems to be the very same device, as already supported Smartjoy
    dual Plus, but with slightly different vendor ID. Let's support this
    one too.

    HID: remove ignore quirk for MGE UPS devices
    
    This patch reverts the change made four years ago here:
    http://www.vg.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/usb/2.4/usb-hid-2.4.25-pre7.patch
    
    UPS's made by MGE can be used with usbhid just fine, and by removing the
    ignore quirk allows them to be used with HAL so they just work when plugged
    in, without needing to be manually configured.
    
    With the ignore quirk in place a user would have to configure NUT before the
    UPS could be used, as NUT uses it's own internal USB matching framework
    to match against the USB devices, do low level control messages on the
    device and then parse the HID tables all in userspace.
    
    This is not needed, as allowing the device to be claimed as a usbhid device
    allows it to be used like any other USB UPS device. The devices correctly
    advertise the power device page which can be queried for the device state.
    
    I assume the quirk was changed so that people using < libusb 0.1.8 could
    still use NUT's internal HID code to manage the UPS.
    libusb 0.1.8 was released quite some time ago: 2004-02-11.
    
    This patch does not break NUT as in drivers/libusb.c the device is force
    unbound from the kernel driver using usb_detach_kernel_driver_np () where
    it can be controlled like normal.

    Also add generic drivers for both usb and bt into usbhid or hidp

    will be either grabbed by special drivers or by nobody if they are broken at

    netfilter: ctnetlink: remove bogus module dependency between ctnetlink and nf_nat
    
    This patch removes the module dependency between ctnetlink and
    nf_nat by means of an indirect call that is initialized when
    nf_nat is loaded. Now, nf_conntrack_netlink only requires
    nf_conntrack and nfnetlink.
    
    This patch puts nfnetlink_parse_nat_setup_hook into the
    nf_conntrack_core to avoid dependencies between ctnetlink,
    nf_conntrack_ipv4 and nf_conntrack_ipv6.
    
    This patch also introduces the function ctnetlink_change_nat
    that is only invoked from the creation path. Actually, the
    nat handling cannot be invoked from the update path since
    this is not allowed. By introducing this function, we remove
    the useless nat handling in the update path and we avoid
    deadlock-prone code.
    
    This patch also adds the required EAGAIN logic for nfnetlink.

    ocfs2: Make cached block reads the common case.
    
    ocfs2_read_blocks() currently requires the CACHED flag for cached I/O.
    However, that's the common case.  Let's flip it around and provide an
    IGNORE_CACHE flag for the special users.  This has the added benefit of
    cleaning up the code some (ignore_cache takes on its special meaning
    earlier in the loop).

    netfilter: restore lost #ifdef guarding defrag exception
    
    Nir Tzachar <nir.tzachar@gmail.com> reported a warning when sending
    fragments over loopback with NAT:
    
    [ 6658.338121] WARNING: at net/ipv4/netfilter/nf_nat_standalone.c:89 nf_nat_fn+0x33/0x155()
    
    The reason is that defragmentation is skipped for already tracked connections.
    This is wrong in combination with NAT and ip_conntrack actually had some ifdefs
    to avoid this behaviour when NAT is compiled in.
    
    The entire "optimization" may seem a bit silly, for now simply restoring the
    lost #ifdef is the easiest solution until we can come up with something better.

    ocfs2: Simplify ocfs2_read_block()
    
    More than 30 callers of ocfs2_read_block() pass exactly OCFS2_BH_CACHED.
    Only six pass a different flag set.  Rather than have every caller care,
    let's make ocfs2_read_block() take no flags and always do a cached read.
    The remaining six places can call ocfs2_read_blocks() directly.

    ocfs2: Separate out sync reads from ocfs2_read_blocks()
    
    The ocfs2_read_blocks() function currently handles sync reads, cached,
    reads, and sometimes cached reads.  We're going to add some
    functionality to it, so first we should simplify it.  The uncached,
    synchronous reads are much easer to handle as a separate function, so we
    instroduce ocfs2_read_blocks_sync().

    m68k: Define rtc_lock on Atari
    
    The nvram and rtc-cmos drivers use the spinlock rtc_lock to protect against
    concurrent accesses to the CMOS memory. As m68k doesn't support SMP or preempt
    yet, the spinlock calls tend to get optimized away, but not for all
    configurations, causing in some rare cases:
    
    | ERROR: "rtc_lock" [drivers/rtc/rtc-cmos.ko] undefined!
    | ERROR: "rtc_lock" [drivers/char/nvram.ko] undefined!
    
    Add the spinlock to the Atari core code to avoid this.

    m68k: Reverse platform MMU logic so Sun 3 is last
    
    Currently Sun 3 support is the first platform option, as the Sun 3 MMU is
    incompatible with standard Motorola MMUs. However, this means that
    `allmodconfig' enables support for Sun 3, and thus disables support for all
    other platforms.
    
    Reverse the logic and move Sun 3 last, so `allmodconfig' enables all
    platforms except for Sun 3, increasing compile-coverage.

    i2c-parport-light: Don't register a platform device resource
    
    The i2c-parport-light driver isn't a real platform driver, so it
    should not instantiate platform devices with resources. The resource
    management system can't cope with colliding resources, and we are
    likely to create such a colliding resource.
    
    So, better just try to grab the I/O ports we need right at module
    initialization time, and bail out if we can't. It has the added
    benefit that the module will no longer load if it isn't going to work,
    which is definitely more user-friendly.

    The dme1737 driver support both LPC (ISA) and SMBus devices. At the
    moment it's rather i2c-centric, and LPC variants use a fake i2c_client
    for some operations.
    
    In a near future, i2c_client will be allocated by i2c-core rather than
    by the device drivers, so non-i2c drivers will not have one. As a
    preparation step, change the driver code to no longer assume that
    an i2c_client structure is always available. No functional change.

    i2c-pca-isa: Don't grab arbitrary resources
    
    Grabbing ISA bus resources without anything or anyone telling us we
    should can break boot on randconfig/allyesconfig builds by keeping
    resources that are in fact owned by different hardware busy and does
    as reported by Ingo Molnar.
    
    Generally it's also dangerous to just poke at random I/O ports and
    especially those in the range where other old easily confused ISA
    hardware might live.
    
    For this specialized I2C bus driver, insist that the user specifies

    do_generic_file_read: s/EINTR/EIO/ if lock_page_killable() fails
    
    If lock_page_killable() fails because the task was killed by SIGKILL or
    any other fatal signal, do_generic_file_read() returns -EIO.
    
    This seems to be OK, because in fact the userspace won't see this error,
    the task will dequeue SIGKILL and exit.
    
    However, /sbin/init is different, it will dequeue SIGKILL, ignore it, and
    return to the user-space with the bogus -EIO.
    
    Change the code to return the error code from lock_page_killable(), -EINTR.
    This doesn't fix the bug, but perhaps makes sense anyway. Imho, with this
    change the code looks a bit more logical, and the "good" init should handle
    the spurious EINTR or short read.
    
    Afaics we can also change lock_page_killable() to return -ERESTARTNOINTR,
    but this can't prevent the short reads.

    de2104x: wrong MAC address fix
    
    The de2104x returns sometimes a wrong MAC address. The wrong one is
    like the original one, but it comes with an one byte shift. I found
    this bug on an older alpha ev5 cpu. More details are available in Gentoo
    bugreport #240718.
    
    It seems the hardware is sometimes a little bit too slow for an

    As Mark mentioned, it may be time-consuming when we remove the
    empty xattr bucket, so this patch try to let empty bucket exist

    1. Remove the functin of bucket and extent record deletion during
       xattr delete.
    2. In xattr set:
       1) Don't clean the last entry so that if the bucket is empty,
          the hash value of the bucket is the hash value of the entry
          which is deleted last.
       2) During insert, if we meet with an empty bucket, just use the
          1st entry.
    3. In binary search of xattr bucket, use the bucket hash value(which
       stored in the 1st xattr entry) to find the right place.

    ocfs2: Switch over to JBD2.
    
    ocfs2 wants JBD2 for many reasons, not the least of which is that JBD is
    limiting our maximum filesystem size.
    
    It's a pretty trivial change.  Most functions are just renamed.  The
    only functional change is moving to Jan's inode-based ordered data mode.
    It's better, too.
    
    Because JBD2 reads and writes JBD journals, this is compatible with any
    existing filesystem.  It can even interact with JBD-based ocfs2 as long
    as the journal is formated for JBD.
    
    We provide a compatibility option so that paranoid people can still use
    JBD for the time being.  This will go away shortly.

    ocfs2: Limit inode allocation to 32bits.
    
    ocfs2 inode numbers are block numbers.  For any filesystem with less
    than 2^32 blocks, this is not a problem.  However, when ocfs2 starts
    using JDB2, it will be able to support filesystems with more than 2^32
    blocks.  This would result in inode numbers higher than 2^32.
    
    The problem is that stat(2) can't handle those numbers on 32bit
    machines.  The simple solution is to have ocfs2 allocate all inodes
    below that boundary.
    
    The suballoc code is changed to honor an optional block limit.  Only the
    inode suballocator sets that limit - all other allocations stay unlimited.
    
    The biggest trick is to grow the inode suballocator beneath that limit.
    There's no point in allocating block groups that are above the limit,
    then rejecting their elements later on.  We want to prevent the inode
    allocator from ever having block groups above the limit.  This involves
    a little gyration with the local alloc code.  If the local alloc window
    is above the limit, it signals the caller to try the global bitmap but
    does not disable the local alloc file (which can be used for other
    allocations).

    In ocfs2_xattr_free_block, we take a cluster lock on xb_alloc_inode while we

    it.
    
    We can clean up how xattr blocks are removed while here - this patch also

    In ocfs2_extend_trans, when we can't extend the current

    used(the block isn't dirtied before our extend), we will not

    ocfs2: Make ocfs2_extent_tree the first-class representation of a tree.
    
    We now have three different kinds of extent trees in ocfs2: inode data
    (dinode), extended attributes (xattr_tree), and extended attribute
    values (xattr_value).  There is a nice abstraction for them,
    ocfs2_extent_tree, but it is hidden in alloc.c.  All the calling
    functions have to pick amongst a varied API and pass in type bits and
    often extraneous pointers.
    
    A better way is to make ocfs2_extent_tree a first-class object.
    Everyone converts their object to an ocfs2_extent_tree() via the
    ocfs2_get_*_extent_tree() calls, then uses the ocfs2_extent_tree for all
    tree calls to alloc.c.
    
    This simplifies a lot of callers, making for readability.  It also
    provides an easy way to add additional extent tree types, as they only
    need to be defined in alloc.c with a ocfs2_get_<new>_extent_tree()
    function.

    ocfs2: Create specific get_extent_tree functions.
    
    A caller knows what kind of extent tree they have.  There's no reason
    they have to call ocfs2_get_extent_tree() with a NULL when they could
    just as easily call a specific function to their type of extent tree.
    
    Introduce ocfs2_dinode_get_extent_tree(),
    ocfs2_xattr_tree_get_extent_tree(), and
    ocfs2_xattr_value_get_extent_tree().  They only take the necessary
    arguments, calling into the underlying __ocfs2_get_extent_tree() to do
    the real work.
    
    __ocfs2_get_extent_tree() is the old ocfs2_get_extent_tree(), but
    without needing any switch-by-type logic.
    
    ocfs2_get_extent_tree() is now a wrapper around the specific calls.  It
    exists because a couple alloc.c functions can take et_type.  This will
    go later.
    
    Another benefit is that ocfs2_xattr_value_get_extent_tree() can take a
    struct ocfs2_xattr_value_root* instead of void*.  This gives us
    typechecking where we didn't have it before.

    ocfs2: Enable xattr set in index btree
    
    Where the previous patches added the ability of list/get xattr in buckets
    for ocfs2, this patch enables ocfs2 to store large numbers of EAs.
    
    The original design doc is written by Mark Fasheh, and it can be found in
    http://oss.oracle.com/osswiki/OCFS2/DesignDocs/IndexedEATrees. I only had to
    make small modifications to it.
    
    First, because the bucket size is 4K, a new field named xh_free_start is added
    in ocfs2_xattr_header to indicate the next valid name/value offset in a bucket.
    It is used when we store new EA name/value. With this field, we can find the
    place more quickly and what's more, we don't need to sort the name/value every
    time to let the last entry indicate the next unused space. This makes the
    insert operation more efficient for blocksizes smaller than 4k.
    
    Because of the new xh_free_start, another field named as xh_name_value_len is
    also added in ocfs2_xattr_header. It records the total length of all the
    name/values in the bucket. We need this so that we can check it and defragment
    the bucket if there is not enough contiguous free space.
    
    An xattr insertion looks like this:
    1. xattr_index_block_find: find the right bucket by the name_hash, say bucketA.
    2. check whether there is enough space in bucketA. If yes, insert it directly
       and modify xh_free_start and xh_name_value_len accordingly. If not, check
       xh_name_value_len to see whether we can store this by defragment the bucket.
       If yes, defragment it and go on insertion.
    3. If defragement doesn't work, check whether there is new empty bucket in
       the clusters within this extent record. If yes, init the new bucket and move
       all the buckets after bucketA one by one to the next bucket. Move half of the
       entries in bucketA to the next bucket and go on insertion.
    4. If there is no new bucket, grow the extent tree.
    
    As for xattr deletion, we will delete an xattr bucket when all it's xattrs
    are removed and move all the buckets after it to the previous one. When all
    the xattr buckets in an extend record are freed, free this extend records
    from ocfs2_xattr_tree.

    size we want so that we can prevent ocfs2_insert_extent() from merging the leaf
    record even if it is contiguous with an adjacent record.
    
    Other btree types are not affected by this change.

    2. Find the xattr bucket within the extent which may contain this xattr
    
    3. Iterate the bucket to find the xattr. In ocfs2_xattr_block_get(), we need
       to recalcuate the block offset and name offset for the right position of
       name/value.

    ocfs2: Add xattr bucket iteration for large numbers of EAs
    
    Ocfs2 breaks up xattr index tree leaves into 4k regions, called buckets.
    Attributes are stored within a given bucket, depending on hash value.
    
    After a discussion with Mark, we decided that the per-bucket index
    (xe_entry[]) would only exist in the 1st block of a bucket. Likewise,
    name/value pairs will not straddle more than one block. This allows the
    majority of operations to work directly on the buffer heads in a leaf block.
    
    This patch adds code to iterate the buckets in an EA. A new abstration of
    ocfs2_xattr_bucket is added. It records the bhs in this bucket and
    ocfs2_xattr_header. This keeps the code neat, improving readibility.

    last is for the xattr index btree, which will be used in a followup patch.
    
    All the old callers in file.c etc will call ocfs2_dinode_insert_extent(),
    while the other two handle the xattr issue. And the init of extent tree are
    handled by these functions.
    
    When storing xattr value which is too large, we will allocate some clusters
    for it and here ocfs2_extent_list and ocfs2_extent_rec will also be used. In
    order to re-use the b-tree operation code, a new parameter named "private"
    is added into ocfs2_extent_tree and it is used to indicate the root of
    ocfs2_exent_list. The reason is that we can't deduce the root from the
    buffer_head now. It may be in an inode, an ocfs2_xattr_block or even worse,
    in any place in an ocfs2_xattr_bucket.

    powerpc: Fix DMA offset for non-coherent DMA
    
    After Becky's work we can almost have different DMA offsets
    between on-chip devices and PCI. Almost because there's a
    problem with the non-coherent DMA code that basically ignores
    the programmed offset to use the global one for everything.
    This fixes it.

    ocfs2: Add the basic xattr disk layout in ocfs2_fs.h
    
    Ocfs2 uses a very flexible structure for storing extended attributes on
    disk. Small amount of attributes are stored directly in the inode block - up
    to 256 bytes worth. If that fills up, attributes are also stored in an
    external block, linked to from the inode block. That block can in turn
    expand to a btree, capable of storing large numbers of attributes.
    
    Individual attribute values are stored inline if they're small enough
    (currently about 80 bytes, this can be changed though), and otherwise are
    expanded to a btree. The theoretical limit to the size of an individual
    attribute is about the same as an inode, though the kernel's upper bound on
    the size of an attributes data is far smaller.

    ocfs2: Abstract ocfs2_extent_tree in b-tree operations.
    
    In the old extent tree operation, we take the hypothesis that we
    are using the ocfs2_extent_list in ocfs2_dinode as the tree root.
    As xattr will also use ocfs2_extent_list to store large value
    for a xattr entry, we refactor the tree operation so that xattr
    can use it directly.
    
    The refactoring includes 4 steps:
    1. Abstract set/get of last_eb_blk and update_clusters since they may
       be stored in different location for dinode and xattr.
    2. Add a new structure named ocfs2_extent_tree to indicate the
       extent tree the operation will work on.
    3. Remove all the use of fe_bh and di, use root_bh and root_el in
       extent tree instead. So now all the fe_bh is replaced with
       et->root_bh, el with root_el accordingly.
    4. Make ocfs2_lock_allocators generic. Now it is limited to be only used
       in file extend allocation. But the whole function is useful when we want
       to store large EAs.
    
    Note: This patch doesn't touch ocfs2_commit_truncate() since it is not used
    for anything other than truncate inode data btrees.

    use this for extended attribute trees in the future, so genericize the
    interface the take a buffer head. A future patch will allow that buffer_head
    to contain any structure rooting an ocfs2 btree.

    ocfs2: throttle back local alloc when low on disk space
    
    Ocfs2's local allocator disables itself for the duration of a mount point
    when it has trouble allocating a large enough area from the primary bitmap.
    That can cause performance problems, especially for disks which were only
    temporarily full or fragmented. This patch allows for the allocator to
    shrink it's window first, before being disabled. Later, it can also be
    re-enabled so that any performance drop is minimized.
    
    To do this, we allow the value of osb->local_alloc_bits to be shrunk when
    needed. The default value is recorded in a mostly read-only variable so that
    we can re-initialize when required.
    
    Locking had to be updated so that we could protect changes to
    local_alloc_bits. Mostly this involves protecting various local alloc values
    with the osb spinlock. A new state is also added, OCFS2_LA_THROTTLED, which
    is used when the local allocator is has shrunk, but is not disabled. If the
    available space dips below 1 megabyte, the local alloc file is disabled. In
    either case, local alloc is re-enabled 30 seconds after the event, or when
    an appropriate amount of bits is seen in the primary bitmap.

    ocfs2: POSIX file locks support
    
    This is actually pretty easy since fs/dlm already handles the bulk of the
    work. The Ocfs2 userspace cluster stack module already uses fs/dlm as the
    underlying lock manager, so I only had to add the right calls.
    
    Cluster-aware POSIX locks ("plocks") can be turned off by the same means at
    UNIX locks - mount with 'noflocks', or create a local-only Ocfs2 volume.
    Internally, the file system uses two sets of file_operations, depending on
    whether cluster aware plocks is required. This turns out to be easier than
    implementing local-only versions of ->lock.

    for platforms to use to configure the chip.  Use of a callback allows
    platforms to control the ordering of initialisation which can be
    important.

    mfd: Add GPIO pin configuration support for WM8350
    
    The WM8350 provides a number of user-configurable pins providing access
    to various signals generated by the functions on the chip. These are
    referred to as GPIO pins in the device documentation but in Linux terms
    they are more general than that, providing configuration of alternate
    functions.
    
    This patch implements support for selecting the alternate functions for
    these pins. They can also be used as GPIOs in the normal Linux sense -
    a subsequent patch will add support for doing so.
    
    This code was all written by Liam Girdwood and has had minor updates
    and rearrangements by Mark Brown.

    The WM8350 is an integrated audio and power management subsystem
    intended for use as the primary PMIC in mobile multimedia applications.
    The WM8350 can be controlled via either I2C or SPI - the control
    interface is provided by a separate module in order to allow greatest
    flexibility in configuring the kernel.
    
    This driver was originally written by Liam Girdwood and has since been
    updated to current kernel APIs and split up for submission by me.  All
    the heavy lifting here was done by Liam.

    regulator: core - Rework machine API to remove string based functions.
    
    This improves the machine level API in order to configure
    regulator constraints and consumers as platform data and removes the
    old string based API that required several calls to set up each regulator.
    
    The intention is to create a struct regulator_init_data, populate
    it's fields with constraints, consumers devices, etc and then register
    the regulator device from board.c in the standard Linux way.
    
    e.g. regulator LDO2 (supplying codec and sim) platform data.
    
    /* regulator LDO2 consumer devices */
    static struct regulator_consumer_supply ldo2_consumers[] = {
    {
    	.dev	= &platform_audio_device.dev,
    	.supply	= "codec_avdd",
    },
    {
    	.dev	= &platform_sim_device.dev,
    	.supply	= "sim_vcc",
    }
    };
    
    /* regulator LDO2 constraints  */
    static struct regulator_init_data ldo2_data = {
    	.constraints = {
    		.min_uV = 3300000,
    		.max_uV = 3300000,
    		.valid_modes_mask = REGULATOR_MODE_NORMAL,
    		.apply_uV = 1,
    	},
    	.num_consumer_supplies = ARRAY_SIZE(ldo2_consumers),
    	.consumer_supplies = ldo2_consumers,
    };
    
    /* machine regulator devices with thier consumers and constraints */
    static struct platform_device wm8350_regulator_devices[] = {
    {
    	.name = "wm8350-regulator",
    	.id = WM8350_LDO_2,
    	.dev = {
    		.platform_data = &ldo2_data,
    	},
    },
    };
    
    Changes in detail:-
    
      o Removed all const char* regulator config functions in machine API.
      o Created new struct regulator_init_data to contain regulator
        machine configuration constraints and consmuers.
      o Changed set_supply(), set_machine_constraints(),
        set_consumer_device_supply() to remove their string identifier
        parameters. Also made them static and moved functions nearer top of
        core.c.
      o Removed no longer used inline func to_rdev()
      o Added regulator_get_init_drvdata() to retrieve init data.
      o Added struct device* as parameter to regulator_register().
      o Changed my email address.

    Put some information (and pointers to more) into the kernel's doc tree,
    describing briefly the interface to the kernel's disk head unloading

    system under GNU/Linux can be found on the web and is referenced
    accordingly.
    
    v3:
    Here is some final polish including various spelling corrections
    pointed out by Grant Grundler and Peter Moulder. Also, I have added some
    information about the timing constraints related to disk head parking.
    The patch looks more impressive than it really is and I think it would
    be alright just to incorporate it into the original patch so as not to
    clutter up the git log.

    ide: Implement disk shock protection support (v4)
    
    On user request (through sysfs), the IDLE IMMEDIATE command with UNLOAD
    FEATURE as specified in ATA-7 is issued to the device and processing of
    the request queue is stopped thereafter until the specified timeout
    expires or user space asks to resume normal operation. This is supposed
    to prevent the heads of a hard drive from accidentally crashing onto the
    platter when a heavy shock is anticipated (like a falling laptop expected
    to hit the floor). Port resets are deferred whenever a device on that
    port is in the parked state.

    v4:
    Fix a memory leak due to a missing blk_put_request() in
    issue_park_cmd(). Additionally, we should plug the queue when enqueueing
    the unpark request because there is no guarantee that the park timeout
    has not expired by then. Even though the chance for that to happen is
    very slim, the request might end up hanging in the queue until the next
    I/O operation is queued up. While at it, clean up the code a little:
    - make issue_park_cmd() a function of type void since nobody cares for
      the return value anyway;
    - use blk_start_queueing() instead of __blk_run_queue() since we don't
      have to worry about recursion;
    - remove a superfluous pointer deference in task_no_data_intr().

    ide: switch to DMA-mapping API part #2
    
    Follow-up to commit 5c05ff68b9a9b40a9be949497e0aa980185565cf
    ("ide: switch to DMA-mapping API"):
    
    * pci_{alloc,free}_consistent() -> dma_{alloc,free}_coherent()
      in ide_{allocate,release}_dma_engine().
    
    * Add ->prd_max_nents and ->prd_ent_size fields to ide_hwif_t
      (+ set default values in ide_allocate_dma_engine()).
    
    * Make ide_{allocate,release}_dma_engine() available also
      for CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_SFF=n.  Then convert au1xxx-ide.c,
      scc_pata.c and sgiioc4.c to use them.
    
    * Add missing ->init_dma method to scc_pata.
    
    This patch also fixes:
    - ->dmatable_cpu leak for au1xxx-ide
    - too early realease of ->dmatable_cpu for scc_pata
    - wrong amount of ->dmatable_cpu memory being freed for sgiioc4
    
    While at it:
    - remove superfluous ->dma_base check from ide_unregister()
    - return -ENOMEM on error in ide_release_dma_engine()
    - beautify error message in ide_release_dma_engine()

    ide: Two fixes regarding memory allocation
    
    In function ide_devset_execute() we should use __GFP_WAIT rather than
    GFP_KERNEL. Also, the allocation cannot possibly fail at that point.
    More importantly, there is a potential memory leak in the device probing
    code. The infrastructure seems rather complex and I hope I haven't messed
    anything up by trying to fix this.

    vfs: Use const for kernel parser table
    
    This is a much better version of a previous patch to make the parser
    tables constant. Rather than changing the typedef, we put the "const" in
    all the various places where its required, allowing the __initconst
    exception for nfsroot which was the cause of the previous trouble.
    
    This was posted for review some time ago and I believe its been in -mm

    Right now there are various drivers that try to use tty->count to know when
    they get the final close. Aristeau Rozanski showed while debugging the vt
    sysfs race that this isn't entirely safe.
    
    Instead of driver side tricks to work around this introduce a shutdown which
    is called when the tty is being destructed. This also means that the shutdown
    method is tied into the refcounting.
    
    Use this to rework the console close/sysfs logic.
    
    Remove lots of special case code from the tty core code. The pty code can now
    have a shutdown() method that replaces the special case hackery in the tree
    free up paths.

    vt: remove bogus lock dropping
    
    For hysterical raisins the vt layer drops and retakes locks in the write
    method. This is a left over from the days when user/kernel data was passed
    directly to the tty not pre-buffered.

    "About a RS485 ioctl: could you consider the attached files which are

     TIOCSERSETRS485 (ioctl.h), and the data structure (rs485.h)
     with allows to specify timings. Sounds just like what we want ?"
    
    and he's right: sort of. Rework the structure to use flag bits and make the
    time delay a fixed sized field so we don't get 32/64bit problems. Add the ioctls
    to x86 so that people know what to add to their platform of choice.

    serial: allow 8250 to be used on sparc
    
    This requires three changes:
    
    1) Remove !SPARC restriction in Kconfig.
    
    2) Move Sparc specific serial drivers before 8250, so that serial
       console devices don't change names on us, even if 8250 finds
       devices.
    
    3) Since the Sparc specific serial drivers try to use the
       same major/minor device namespace as 8250, some coordination
       is necessary.  Use the sunserial_*() layer routines to allocate
       minor number space within TTY_MAJOR when CONFIG_SPARC.
    
       This has no effect on other platforms.

    usb: fix pl2303 initialization
    
    This patch removes the private check for the termios_initialized for
    the pl2303 usb driver.  It forced the baud to 9600 on the first call
    to pl2303_set_termios()
    
    Based on the tty changes in the 2.6.27 kernel, the termios passed to
    the *_set_termios functions is always populated the first time.
    
    This means there is no need to privately initialize the settings the
    first time, and doing so will not allow the use of the kernel
    parameter "console=ttyUSB0,115200" as an example.

    audit: Handle embedded NUL in TTY input auditing
    
    Data read from a TTY can contain an embedded NUL byte (e.g. after

    This patch modifies the AUDIT_TTY record to always use the hexadecimal
    format, which does not terminate at the first NUL byte.  The vast
    majority of recorded TTY input data will contain either ' ' or '\n', so
    the hexadecimal format would have been used anyway.

    drivers/char/hvc_console.c: adjust call to put_tty_driver
    
    The call to put_tty_driver is out of place and is applied to the wrong
    argument.
    
    The function enclosing the patched code calls alloc_tty_driver and stores
    the result in drv.  Subsequently, there are two occurrences of error
    handling code, one making a goto to put_tty and one making a goto to
    stop_thread.  At the point of the first one the assignment hvc_driver = drv
    has not yet been executed, and from inspecting the rest of the file it
    seems that hvc_driver would be NULL.  Thus the current call to
    put_tty_driver is useless, and one applied to drv is needed.  The goto
    stop_thread is in the error handling code for a call to
    tty_register_driver, but the error cases in tty_register_driver do not free
    its argument, so it should be done here.  Thus, I have moved the put_tty
    label after the stop_thread label, so that put_tty_driver is called in both
    cases.
    
    The semantic match that finds this problem is as follows:

    powerpc: fix fsl_upm nand driver modular build
    
    The fsl_upm nand driver fails to build because fsl_lbc_lock isn't
    exported, the lock is needed by the inlined fsl_upm_run_pattern()
    function:
    
    ERROR: "fsl_lbc_lock" [drivers/mtd/nand/fsl_upm.ko] undefined!
    
    Dave Jones purposed to export the lock, but it is better to just uninline
    the fsl_upm_run_pattern().
    
    When uninlined we also no longer need the exported fsl_lbc_regs, and
    both fsl_lbc_lock and fsl_lbc_regs could be marked static.
    
    While at it, also add some missing includes that we should have included
    explicitly.

    powerpc: reserve two DMA channels for audio in MPC8610 HPCD device tree
    
    The Freescale Elo DMA driver binds to all DMA channels in the device tree that
    are compatible with "fsl,eloplus-dma-channel".  This conflicts with the sound
    drivers for the MPC8610 HPCD.  On this board, the SSI uses two DMA channels and
    therefore those channels are not available for general purpose use.  We
    change the compatible properties for these channels "fsl,ssi-dma-channel".
    This works because the sound drivers don't actually check the compatible
    property when it grabs channels.

    The "fsl,ssi-dma-channel" compatible property is used to specify a DMA channel
    on the Freescale Elo DMA controller that should be used exclusively by the

    DMA driver will ignore it, and so it will be available for the sound drivers.

    powerpc: remove support for bootmem-allocated memory for the DIU driver
    
    Early versions of the Freescale DIU framebuffer driver depended on a bootmem
    allocation of memory for the video buffer.  The need for this feature was
    removed in commit 6b51d51a, so now we can remove the platform-specific code
    that allocated that memory.

    adjusted whitespace instead of deleting the old load in the iside

    powerpc: 83xx: pci: Remove need for get_immrbase from mpc83xx_add_bridge.
    
    Modify mpc83xx_add_bridge to get config space register base address from
    the device tree instead of immr + hardcoded offset.
    
    83xx pci nodes have this change:
        register properties now contain two address length tuples:
    	First is the pci bridge register base, this has always been there.
    	Second is the config base, this is new.
    
    This is documented in dts-bindings/fsl/83xx-512x-pci.txt
    
    The changes accomplish these things:
        mpc83xx_add_bridge no longer needs to call get_immrbase
        it uses hard coded addresses if the second register value is missing

    powerpc/83xx: don't probe broken PCI on mpc837x_mds boards
    
    In the standalone setup the board's CPLD disables the PCI internal
    arbiter, thus any access to the PCI bus will hang the board.
    
    The common way to disable particular devices in the device tree is to
    put the "status" property with any value other than "ok" or "okay"
    into the device node we want to disable.
    
    So, when there is no PCI arbiter on the bus the u-boot adds status =
    "broken (no arbiter)" property into the PCI controller's node, and so
    marks the PCI controller as unavailable.

    Modify the Kconfig so that Freescale QUICC Engine (QE) support is a selectable
    option, thereby allowing users to compile kernels without any QE support.
    
    The drawback is that QE support is now disabled by default on platforms that
    have a QE, and so a defconfig is needed to enable QE and QE devices (like
    UCC GETH).  Fortunately, all the current relevant defconfigs do that already.

    x86/mm: do not trigger a kernel warning if user-space disables interrupts and generates a page fault
    
    Arjan reported a spike in the following bug pattern in v2.6.27:
    
       http://www.kerneloops.org/searchweek.php?search=lock_page
    
    which happens because hwclock started triggering warnings due to
    a (correct) might_sleep() check in the MM code.
    
    The warning occurs because hwclock uses this dubious sequence of
    code to run "atomic" code:
    
      static unsigned long
      atomic(const char *name, unsigned long (*op)(unsigned long),
             unsigned long arg)
      {
        unsigned long v;
        __asm__ volatile ("cli");
        v = (*op)(arg);
        __asm__ volatile ("sti");
        return v;
      }
    
    Then it pagefaults in that "atomic" section, triggering the warning.
    
    There is no way the kernel could provide "atomicity" in this path,
    a page fault is a cannot-continue machine event so the kernel has to
    wait for the page to be filled in.
    
    Even if it was just a minor fault we'd have to take locks and might have
    to spend quite a bit of time with interrupts disabled - not nice to irq
    latencies in general.
    
    So instead just enable interrupts in the pagefault path unconditionally
    if we come from user-space, and handle the fault.
    
    Also, while touching this code, unify some trivial parts of the x86
    VM paths at the same time.

    Automatic MODULE_ALIAS() for DMI match tables.
    
    This makes modpost handle MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(dmi, xxxx).
    
    I had to change the string pointers in the match table to char arrays,
    and picked a size of 79 bytes almost at random -- do we need to make it
    bigger than that? I was a bit concerned about the 'bloat' this
    introduces into the match tables, but they should all be __initdata so
    it shouldn't matter too much.
    
    (Actually, modpost does go through the relocations and look at most of
    them; it wouldn't be impossible to make it handle string pointers -- but
    doesn't seem to be worth the effort, since they're __initdata).

    V4L/DVB (9168): Add support for MSI TV@nywhere Plus remote
    
    The IR controller has a couple quirks. It won't respond until some other
    device on the bus is probed. To work around that, probe 0x50 first.
    Then, since it won't respond to a zero-byte read, probe with a one-byte
    read.

    Also removed a forced yuv position update, since changing the source video

    The service_set field was used in saa7115 and cx25840 to determine

    perfectly valid to select sliced VBI with a service_set of 0.

    x86: allow number of additional hotplug CPUs to be set at compile time, V2
    
    x86: allow number of additional hotplug CPUs to be set at compile time, V2
    
    The default number of additional CPU IDs for hotplugging is determined
    by asking ACPI or mptables how many "disabled" CPUs there are in the
    system, but many systems get this wrong so that e.g. a uniprocessor
    machine gets an extra CPU allocated and never switches to single CPU
    mode.
    
    And sometimes CPU hotplugging is enabled only for suspend/hibernate
    anyway, so the additional CPU IDs are not wanted. Allow the number
    to be set to zero at compile time.
    
    Also, force the number of extra CPUs to zero if hotplugging is disabled
    which allows removing some conditional code.
    
    Tested on uniprocessor x86_64 that ACPI claims has a disabled processor,
    with CPU hotplugging configured.
    
    ("After" has the number of additional CPUs set to 0)

    x86: do not allow to optimize flag_is_changeable_p() (rev. 2)
    
    The flag_is_changeable_p() is used by
    has_cpuid_p() which can return different results
    in the code sequence below:
    
     if (!have_cpuid_p())
          identify_cpu_without_cpuid(c);
    
      /* cyrix could have cpuid enabled via c_identify()*/
      if (!have_cpuid_p())
          return;
    
    Otherwise, the gcc 3.4.6 optimizes these two calls
    into one which make the code not working correctly.
    
    Cyrix cpus have the CPUID instruction enabled before
    the second call to the have_cpuid_p() but
    it is not detected due to the gcc optimization.
    Thus the ARR registers (mtrr like) are not detected
    on such a cpu.

    traps: x86_64: remove trace_hardirqs_fixup from DO_ERROR_INFO macro
    
    All exceptions are taken via interrupt gates. TRACE_IRQS_OFF
    is called just before entering the C code, so the irq state
    is known to the irq tracer at this point. No need to call
    trace_hardirqs_fixup.

    early_ioremap() is also used to map normal memory when constructing

    add a early_memremap() call, which maps with PAGE_KERNEL (as opposed
    to PAGE_KERNEL_IO for early_ioremap()), and use it when constructing

    x86: add _PAGE_IOMAP pte flag for IO mappings
    
    Use one of the software-defined PTE bits to indicate that a mapping is
    intended for an IO address.  On native hardware this is irrelevent,
    since a physical address is a physical address.  But in a virtual
    environment, physical addresses are also virtualized, so there needs
    to be some way to distinguish between pseudo-physical addresses and
    actual hardware addresses; _PAGE_IOMAP indicates this intent.
    
    By default, __supported_pte_mask masks out _PAGE_IOMAP, so it doesn't
    even appear in the final pagetable.

    arch/x86/kernel/smpboot.c: Clarify when irq processing begins.
    
    Secondary cpus start with local interrupts disabled.
    start_secondary() first initializes the new cpu, then it enables the
    local interrupts. (although interrupts are enabled within smp_callin()
    as well).
    
    Right now, the local interrupts are enabled as a side effect of calling
    ipi_call_lock_irq().
    
    The attached patch clarifies when local interrupts are enabled.

    powerpc/xics: EOI xics ipi by hand in kexec
    
    EOI normally has the side effect of returning the cpu to the base
    priority to recieve the next interrupt.  This is actually controlled
    by the top byte of the xirr register.   When we are exiting the
    kernel in kexec we must eoi the ipi for the next kernel because we
    never return from the handler, but we want to leave interrupt
    delivery blocked until the next kernel takes action.
    
    Since the hardware ipi vector is fixed, its easiest to just do the
    eoi explicitly.

    powerpc/xics: Consolidate ipi message encode and decode
    
    xics supports only one ipi per cpu, and expects software to use some
    queue to know why the interrupt was sent.  In Linux, we use a an array
    of bitmaps indexed by cpu to identify the message.  Currently the bits
    are set in smp.c and decoded in xics.c, with the data structure in a
    header file.   Consolidate the code in xics.c similar to mpic and other
    interrupt controllers.
    
    Also, while making the the array static, the message word doesn't need
    to be volatile as set_bit and test_clear_bit take care of it for us, and
    put it under ifdef smp.

    md: Relax minimum size restrictions on chunk_size.
    
    Currently, the 'chunk_size' of an array must be at-least PAGE_SIZE.
    
    This makes moving an array to a machine with a larger PAGE_SIZE, or
    changing the kernel to use a larger PAGE_SIZE, can stop an array from
    working.
    
    For RAID10 and RAID4/5/6, this is non-trivial to fix as the resync
    process works on whole pages at a time, and assumes them to be wholly
    within a stripe.  For other raid personalities, this restriction is
    not needed at all and can be dropped.
    
    So remove the test on chunk_size from common can, and add it in just
    the places where it is needed: raid10 and raid4/5/6.

    md: Convert remaining 1k representations in linear.c to sectors.
    
    This patch renames hash_spacing and preshift to  spacing and
    sector_shift respectively with the following change of semantics:
    
    Case 1: (sizeof(sector_t) <= sizeof(u32)).
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    In this case, we have sector_shift = preshift = 0 and spacing =
    2 * hash_spacing.
    
    Hence, the index for the hash table which is computed by the new code
    in which_dev() as sector / spacing equals the old value which was
    (sector/2) / hash_spacing.
    
    Note also that the value of nb_zone stays the same because both sz
    and base double.
    
    Case 2: (sizeof(sector_t) > sizeof(u32)).
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    (aka the shifting dance case). Here we have sector_shift = preshift +
    1 and
    
    spacing = 2 * hash_spacing
    
    during the computation of nb_zone and curr_sector, but
    
    spacing = hash_spacing
    
    in which_dev() because in the last hunk of the patch for linear.c we
    shift down conf->spacing (= 2 * hash_spacing) by one more bit than
    in the old code.
    
    Hence in the computation of nb_zone, sz and base have the same value
    as before, so nb_zone is not affected. Also curr_sector in the next
    hunk stays the same.
    
    In which_dev() the hash table index is computed as
    
    (sector >> sector_shift) / spacing
    
    In view of sector_shift = preshift + 1 and spacing = hash_spacing,
    this equals
    
    ((sector/2) >> preshift) / hash_spacing
    
    which is the value computed by the old code.

    md: Allow metadata_version to be updated for externally managed metadata.
    
    For externally managed metadata, the 'metadata_version' sysfs
    attribute is really just a channel for user-space programs to
    communicate about how the array is being managed.
    It can be useful for this to be changed while the array is active.
    
    Normally changes to metadata_version are not permitted while the array
    is active.  Change that so that if the metadata is externally managed,
    the metadata_version can be changed to a different flavour of external
    management.

    ALSA: ASoC: Make TLV320AIC26 user-visible
    
    The TLV320AIC26 Kconfig option is unusual in that it supports the
    OpenFirmware machine driver which doesn't have a hard binding to the
    codec driver but discovers the codec via the device tree.  This makes it
    meaningful to select the codec without a machine driver.
    
    Ideally there would be a proxy entry so that this option was only
    visible on OpenFirmware systems.

    The WM8510 microphone input PGA was represented as a DAPM PGA but in
    DAPM terms the functionality is that of a mixer since it takes three

    was causing its controls to be misinterpreted as gain controls and

    powerpc/xics: Update default_server during migrate_irqs_away
    
    Currently, every time we determine which irq server to use, we check if
    default_server, which is the id of the bootcpu, is still online.  But
    default_server is a hardware cpu, not the logical cpu id needed to index
    cpu_online_map.
    
    Since the default server can only go offline during a cpu hotplug event,
    explicitly check the default server and choose the new one when we move
    irqs away from the cpu being offlined.
    
    This has the added benefit of only needing the boot_cpuid to be updated
    and not relying on the cpu being marked offline during migrate_irqs_away.
    
    Also, since xics_update_irq_servers only reads device tree information, we
    can call it before xics_init_host in xics_init_IRQ and then default_server
    will always be valid when we can reach get_irq_server via the host ops.

    powerpc/xics: EOI unmapped irqs after disabling them
    
    When reciving an irq vector that does not have a linux mapping, the kernel
    prints a message and calls RTAS to disable the irq source.   Previously
    the kernel did not EOI the interrupt, causing the source to think it is
    still being processed by software.  While this does add an additional
    layer of protection against interrupt storms had RTAS failed to disable
    the source, it also prevents the interrupt from working when a driver
    later enables it.  (We could alternatively send an EOI on startup, but
    that strategy would likely fail on an emulated xics.)
    
    All interrupts should be disabled when the kernel starts, but this can
    be observed if a driver does not shutdown an interrupt in its reboot
    hook before starting a new kernel with kexec.
    
    Michael reports this can be reproduced trivially by banging the keyboard
    while kexec'ing on a P5 LPAR: even though the hvc_console driver request's
    the console irq later in boot, the console is non-functional because
    we're receiving no console interrupts.

    integrity: special fs magic
    
    Discussion on the mailing list questioned the use of these
    magic values in userspace, concluding these values are already
    exported to userspace via statfs and their correct/incorrect
    usage is left up to the userspace application.
    
      - Move special fs magic number definitions to magic.h
      - Add magic.h include

    Fix RTC wakealarm sysfs interface breakage.
    
    Commit ed458df4d2470adc02762a87a9ad665d0b1a2bd4 ("PnP: move
    pnpacpi/pnpbios_init to after PCI init") moved the PnP RTC discovery
    later, and now the ACPI RTC glue code doesn't find it any more, breaking
    the RTC wakealarm sysfs interfaces, as reported by Rafael.
    
    This really is fairly messy, and we have several annoying ordering
    constraints here - the PnP code that sets up the RTC resources wants to
    run after the PCI resources have to be registered, which in turn needs
    to run after ACPI has at least enumerated the root PCI buses etc.  Our
    initcall ordering is not fine-grained enough to make this all painless.
    
    So this moves the ACPI RTC glue ("acpi_rtc_init()") down to a regular
    module call, which fixes the problem Rafael has.  The reason this isn't
    wonderful is that we really should do acpi_rtc_init before we do the
    rtc_cmos init, and now those two are in the same module_init() section.
    
    Which happens to work, but only because drivers/rtc is linked after
    drivers/acpi.  In other words, we still have a very subtle ordering
    issue here. Grr.

    raid: make RAID autodetect default a KConfig option
    
    RAID autodetect has the side effect of requiring synchronisation
    of all device drivers, which can make the boot several seconds longer
    (I've measured 7 on one of my laptops).... even for systems that don't
    have RAID setup for the root filesystem (the only FS where this matters).
    
    This patch makes the default for autodetect a config option; either way
    the user can always override via the kernel command line.

    fastboot: make the raid autodetect code wait for all devices to init
    
    The raid autodetect code really needs to have all devices probed before
    it can detect raid arrays; not doing so would give rather messy situations
    where arrays would get detected as degraded while they shouldn't be etc.
    
    This is in preparation of removing the "wait for everything to init"
    code that makes everyone pay, not just raid users.

    what is going on at which time. In addition, with some of the initializing
    going asynchronous soon, it's valuable to track/print which worker thread
    is executing the initialization.
    
    This patch adds a script to turn a dmesg into a SVG graph (that can be
    shown with tools such as InkScape, Gimp or Firefox) and a small change
    to the initcall code to print the PID of the thread calling the initcall
    (so that the script can work out the parallelism).

    V4L/DVB (9135): cx88 Dvico FusionHDTV Pro
    
    Well, one thing you encouraged me to do was re-test some of my cards
    which contained the xc3028-zarlink combo.
    
    Which led me to test a Dvico FusionHDTV Pro.
    
    Almost a year ago, Chris Pascoe did a patch for this which can be found
    at his ~pascoe/xc-test at Linuxtv.
    This worked very well, however that was using his version of firmware.
    
    Alas, someone attempted to use this and patch v4l-dvb, and messed it up.
    So I've fixed it.
    I enclose the patch against today's tree (containing your latest
    tuner-xc2028.c patch).
    
    The card now works very well, well with DVB-T anyway.

    V4L/DVB (9133): v4l: disconnect kernel number from minor
    
    The v4l core creates four different video devices (video, vbi, radio, vtx)
    and each has its own range of minor numbers. However, modern devices keep
    increasing the number of devices that they need so a maximum of 64 video
    devices will not be enough in the future. In addition this scheme makes
    it very hard to add new device types.
    
    This patch disconnects the kernel number allocation (e.g. video0, video1,
    etc.) from the actual minor number (just pick the first free minor).
    
    This allows for much more flexibility in the future. However, it does
    require the use of udev. For those who cannot use udev a new CONFIG option
    was created that changes the allocation scheme back to the old behavior.
    
    Thanks to Greg KH for suggesting this approach during the 2008 LPC.
    
    In addition, several bugs were fixed in the ivtv and cx18 drivers: these
    drivers try to allocate specific kernel numbers but that scheme contained
    a bug which caused what should have been e.g. video17 to appear as e.g.
    video2.

    This patch creates a new usb-radio driver, radio-mr800.c, that
    supports the AverMedia MR 800 USB FM radio devices.
    This device plugs into both the USB and an analog audio input, so this
    thing only deals with initialization and frequency setting, the audio
    data has to be handled by a sound driver.

    This patch against latest mercurial makes DVB-T working on Pinnacle
    Hybrid PCTV Pro (pctv310c).
    
    In cx88-dvb.c, a specific zl10353_config is created with the if2
    inferred from the old comment in the currently used config. It is then
    used for attach, and i2c_gate_ctrl is set to NULL.
    
    The entry in cx88-cards.c is modified with GPIO gathered from windows
    with regspy, and DVB enabled. The frontend is set to
    XC3028_FE_ZARLINK456 to match the zl10353_config.
    
    It is working great with the freeview channels I can receive.

    V4L/DVB (9055): tuner-xc2028: Do a better job selecting firmware type
    
    Firmware selection is very tricky on this device. This patch do a better
    selection of the proper firmware type, by using a code to hint if the
    firmware to be loaded should be D2620 or D2633.
    
    It also allows overriding the hint at the control structure.

    Remove tuner_callback pointers from tuner driver configuration

    A new parameter is added to the callback function, called
    component. This allows us to use this callback pointer by
    frontend components other than the tuner, if need be. So
    far, this is only used by tuner drivers.

    V4L/DVB (9039): Add support for new i2c API provided in firmware version 1.20
    
    The Pinnacle PCTV HD Pro has an xc5000, which exposed a bug in the dib0700's
    i2c implementation where it did not properly support a single i2c read request
    (sending it as an i2c write request instead).  Version 1.20 of the firmware
    added support for a new i2c API which supported such requests.
    
    This change defaults to fw 1.20 for all devices, but does not default to using
    the new i2c API (since initial testing suggests problems interacting with the
    mt2060).  Maintainers can enable the use of the new i2c API by putting
    the following into their frontend initialization:
    
    struct dib0700_state *st = adap->dev->priv;
    st->fw_use_new_i2c_api = 1;
    
    Also note that the code expects i2c repeated start to be supported.  If the
    i2c slave does not support repeated start, i2c messsages should have the
    I2C_M_NOSTART flag set.
    
    Thanks to Patrick Boettcher <patrick.boettcher@desy.de> for providing new
    firmware fixing the issue as well as example i2c code utilizing the interface.

    V4L/DVB (9036): uvcvideo: Fix control cache access when setting composite auto-update controls
    
    Auto-update controls are never marked is loaded to prevent uvc_get_ctrl from
    loading the control value from the cache. When setting a composite (mapped to
    several V4L2 controls) auto-update UVC control, the driver updates the control
    cache value before processing each V4L2 control, overwriting the previously
    set V4L2 control.
    
    This fixes the problem by marking all controls as loaded in uvc_set_ctrl
    regardless of their type and resetting the loaded flag in uvc_commit_ctrl for
    auto-update controls.

    V4L/DVB (9034): With the recent patch to v4l2 titled "v4l2: use register_chrdev_region
    
    instead of register_chrdev", the internal reference count is no longer
    necessary in order to free the internal stk_webcam struct. This patch
    removes the reference counter from the stk_webcam struct and frees the
    struct via the video_device release callback. It also fixes an
    associated bug in stk_camera_probe which could result from
    video_unregister_device being called before video_register_device.
    Lastly, it simplifies access to the stk_webcam struct in several
    places. This patch should apply cleanly against the "working" branch
    of the v4l-dvb git repository.
    
    This patch is identical to the patch I sent a couple of months back
    titled "stk-webcam: Fix video_device handling" except that it has been
    rebased against current modifications to stk-webcam and it no longer
    depends on any other outstanding patches.

    V4L/DVB (9025): S2API: Deactivate the ISDB-T definitions
    
    We don't want to push the ISDB-T definitions into the kernel until
    we have a high level of confidence in the ISDB-T API. More testing
    is required before this code is released.

    V4L/DVB (9016): HVR3000/4000 Hauppauge related IR cleanups
    
    From the author:
    This patch-set fixes remote control issues I have experienced
    with hauppauge drivers in Linux since the PVR-350 and now
    with both a NOVA-S+ and HVR-4000. It has also been confirmed
    to work with an HVR-1300 user who had exactly the same issue.
    
    Hauppage remote controls use RC5. RC5 has a bit-field which
    represents the target device. The hauppauge windows drivers
    have a registry key which can enable filtering, but the linux
    drivers will accept any target device in this bit field for
    internal processing.
    
    This causes problems with setups such as mythtv where remote
    control key presses destined for the TV (target = 0) are
    interpreted by the kernel and subsequenctly LIRC then mythtv.
    
    Of the remote controls I have to hand (wintv black, pvr/hvr
    silver) the hauppauge remotes send one of two device targets
    ids, these are interpreted by the patch which then filters
    out any non hauppauge addresses.

    V4L/DVB (8999): S2API: Reduce demod driver complexity by using a cache sync
    
    For demod drivers, we want a single tuning function (set_frontend) to have
    access to the properly constructed dvb_frontend_parameters structure, or
    the cache values - regardless of whether the legacy or new API is being used.
    
    This cuts down on redundant code in the demod drivers and ensures the
    tuning parameters are consistent regardless of the API entry type.

    After discussion the following changes were made:
    1. Removed the typedefs in frontend.h, use structures.
    2. In the frontend.h, remove the 16 command limit on the API and
       switch to a flexible variable length API. For practical reasons
       a #define limits this to 64, this should be discussed.
    3. Changed dvb-core ioctl handing to deal with variable sequences
       of commands.
    
    tune-v0.0.3.c is required to use this API, it contains the interface changes.

    V4L/DVB (8988): S2API: Allow the properties to call legacy ioctls
    
    SET_TONE and SET_VOLTAGE were not previously implemented. Two options
    existed. Either cut/paste from the previous ioctl handler into the
    process_properties function, which is code duplication. Or, split
    the current ioctl handler into it's two major pieces.
    
    Piece 1, responsible for input validation and semaphore acquiring
    Piece 2 the processing of the previous ioctls
    
    and finally, a new third pieces where the array of properties
    is processed, and can freely call the legacy ioctl handler without
    having to re-acquire the fepriv->sem semaphore. This is a clean approach
    and ensures the existing legacy ioctls are processed as they were previously
    (but with an extra function call) and allows the new API to share code
    without duplication.

    V4L/DVB (8985): S2API: Added dvb frontend changes to support a newer tuning API
    
    This is an experimental patch to add a new tuning mechanism for
    dvb frontends. Rather than passing fixed structures across the
    user/kernel boundary, which need to be revised for each new modulation
    type (or feature the kernel developers want to add), this implements
    a simpler message based approach, allowing fe commands to be broken
    down into a series of small fixed size transactions, presented
    in an array.
    
    The goal is to avoid changing the user/kernel ABI in the future, by
    simply creating new frontend commands (and sequencies of commands) that
    help us add support for brand new demodulator, delivery system or
    statistics related commmands.
    
    known issues:
    checkpatch voilations
    feedback from various developers yet to be implemented, relating
    to namespace conventions, variable length array passing conventions,
    and generally some optimization.
    
    This patch should support all existing tuning mechanisms through the
    new API, as well as adding 8PSK, DVB-S2 NBC-QPSK and ISDB-T API support.
    
    For testing and exercise purposes, see the latest tune.c tool
    available from http://www.steventoth.net/linux/s2

    cx18: Throttle mmio to/from the CX23418 so boards work in older systems.  The
    CX23418 couldn't reliably handle mmio at the rate at which the cx18 driver was
    attempting to access the chip.  The PCI bridge arrangements and settings on
    modern motherboards still allowed the CX23418 to work OK, but it didn't work
    well on many older motherboards: mysterious I2C errors, firmware loading errors,
    etc.  This patch adds a throttle to *all* mmio access to the CX23418.  It
    defaults to a delay of 31 ns, but is adjustable by the mmio_ndelay module parm.
    My HVR-1600 and Raptor PAL/SECAM card now function for analog capture on a
    motherboard with an Intel 82810E Northbridge and 82801AA Southbridge.

    The earlier change from Hans Verkuil that pushed the BKL from

    internal structures through other means, thus the BKL is not required.
    This change reverses Hans' previous change, for the pvrusb2 driver.
    
    It probably would have been a good idea for Hans to previously have
    asked for my ack before committing his change.

    Ensure that the release() is called when the very last chardev usage was
    released, and not when the sysfs devices were removed. This should simplify
    hotpluggable drivers considerably.

    This patch is on behalf of Stephen Backway <stev391@email.com>, and
    represents two patches I received (and some subsequent whitespace
    cleanup I had due to how I pulled the patches).
    
    From the original author:
    
    a) Add DVB support for the Leadtek Winfast PxDVR3200 H.
    
    b) The tuner callback previously checked the command 3 times:
    1) To see if it was the XC2028_RESET_CLK
    2) To see if it was not the XC2028_RESET_TUNER
    3) To see if it was the XC2028_RESET_TUNER
    This patch removes the third check.

    When buffer_setup is run we start the TS initialization: set SAA7134_TS_STOPPED.
    When all buffers are prepared we write data into DMA register and set

    This driver sure needs some rework. For now, let's

    checkpatch.pl still not happy with this driver after
    this patch, but the most annoying errors are gone,
    comments now use C-style only, labels are well placed
    and some other minor fixes.
    
    Some more clean up patches will come as I work on this
    driver. Please review it carefully.

    lot of effort continually updating this driver to stay in sync
    with the latest internal V4L2 or I2C API.

    V4L/DVB (8654): cxusb: add support for DViCO FusionHDTV DVB-T Dual Digital 4 (rev 2)
    
    Add support for revision 2 of the DViCO FusionHDTV DVB-T Dual Digital 4
    which has new tuners and demodulators (2 x DIB7070p). With this patch
    both DVB reception and IR works.
    
    The dib7000p driver currently hardwires the output mode to
    OUTMODE_MPEG2_SERIAL regardless of what we ask for. Modify it to allow
    OUTMODE_MPEG2_PAR_GATED_CLK to be set. Longer term we should remove the
    check completely and set the output mode correctly in all the callers.
    
    Add Kconfig bits to ensure the dib7000p and dib0070 modules are enabled.
    It would be nice to only do this for the !DVB_FE_CUSTOMISE case, but
    this is what the other DIB7070 module does (there are a number of
    module dependencies in the attach code).

    V4L/DVB (8625): saa7134: Add NEC prococol IR decoding capability
    
    This patch adds the capability of decoding NEC protocol, received via GPIO18 line.
    This GPIO port can trigger saa7134 IRQ.
    
    A future improvement would be to make it a little more generic to work also
    with GPIO16 line.
    
    A pure IRQ code didn't work, since some delays were introduced on the tests we
    did.
    
    A possible approach would be to use polling at a rate of 2.5 ms or less. If a
    new code were taken, a code similar to nec_task() could be used. However, this
    would add an extra overhead to kernel, and will consume more power.
    
    Due to that, we took an hybrid approach: an IRQ upper half to trigger when a
    new key is received and a bottom half to convert pulse-distance into a keycode.
    
    The bottom half is polling based, to improve performance. During the bottom
    half proccess, GPIO18 IRQ line is disabled, preventing IRQ reentrancy and
    improving performance a little bit.

    sdhci: 'scratch' may be used uninitialized
    
    The variable 'scratch' is always initialized before it's used. The
    conditional which is responsible for initialization of 'scratch' will
    always evaluate 'true' when the first loop iteration occurs, and thus,
    it's properly initialized. GCC doesn't see this, of course, so using
    the uninitialized_var() macro seems to work for silencing this case.

    The card detection delay was added early when the behaviour of the

    reduce the delay to something more sensible.

    ipvs: Add proper dependencies on IP_VS, and fix description header line.
    
    Linus noted a build failure case:
    
    net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_xmit.c: In function 'ip_vs_tunnel_xmit':
    net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_xmit.c:616: error: implicit declaration of function 'ip_select_ident'
    
    The proper include file (net/ip.h) is being included in ip_vs_xmit.c to get
    that declaration.  So the only possible case where this can happen is if
    CONFIG_INET is not enabled.
    
    This seems to be purely a missing dependency in the ipvs/Kconfig file IP_VS
    entry.
    
    Also, while we're here, remove the out of date "EXPERIMENTAL" string in the
    IP_VS config help header line.  IP_VS no longer depends upon CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL

    security: avoid calling a NULL function pointer in drivers/video/tvaudio.c
    
    NULL function pointers are very bad security wise. This one got caught by
    kerneloops.org quite a few times, so it's happening in the field....
    
    Fix is simple, check the function pointer for NULL, like 6 other places
    in the same function are already doing.

    net: fix dummy 'nf_conntrack_event_cache()'
    
    The dummy version of 'nf_conntrack_event_cache()' (used when the
    NF_CONNTRACK_EVENTS config option is not enabled) had not been updated
    when the calling convention changed.
    
    This was introduced by commit a71996fccce4b2086a26036aa3c915365ca36926
    ("netfilter: netns nf_conntrack: pass conntrack to

    ext4: add an option to control error handling on file data
    
    If the journal doesn't abort when it gets an IO error in file data
    blocks, the file data corruption will spread silently.  Because
    most of applications and commands do buffered writes without fsync(),
    they don't notice the IO error.  It's scary for mission critical
    systems.  On the other hand, if the journal aborts whenever it gets
    an IO error in file data blocks, the system will easily become
    inoperable.  So this patch introduces a filesystem option to
    determine whether it aborts the journal or just call printk() when
    it gets an IO error in file data.
    
    If you mount an ext4 fs with data_err=abort option, it aborts on file
    data write error.  If you mount it with data_err=ignore, it doesn't
    abort, just call printk().  data_err=ignore is the default.
    
    Here is the corresponding patch of the ext3 version:

    jbd2: don't dirty original metadata buffer on abort
    
    Currently, original metadata buffers are dirtied when they are
    unfiled whether the journal has aborted or not.  Eventually these
    buffers will be written-back to the filesystem by pdflush.  This
    means some metadata buffers are written to the filesystem without
    journaling if the journal aborts.  So if both journal abort and
    system crash happen at the same time, the filesystem would become
    inconsistent state.  Additionally, replaying journaled metadata
    can overwrite the latest metadata on the filesystem partly.
    Because, if the journal gets aborted, journaled metadata are
    preserved and replayed during the next mount not to lose
    uncheckpointed metadata.  This would also break the consistency
    of the filesystem.
    
    This patch prevents original metadata buffers from being dirtied
    on abort by clearing BH_JBDDirty flag from those buffers.  Thus,
    no metadata buffers are written to the filesystem without journaling.

    have to keep the contents of the journal space.  Otherwise, the
    filesystem will lose uncheckpointed metadata completely and
    become inconsistent.  To avoid this, we need to keep needs_recovery
    flag if checkpoint has failed.
    
    With this patch, ext4_put_super() detects a checkpointing failure
    from the return value of journal_destroy(), then it invokes
    ext4_abort() to make the filesystem read only and keep
    needs_recovery flag.  Errors from jbd2_journal_flush() are also
    handled by this patch in some places.

    jbd2: fix error handling for checkpoint io
    
    When a checkpointing IO fails, current JBD2 code doesn't check the
    error and continue journaling.  This means latest metadata can be
    lost from both the journal and filesystem.
    
    This patch leaves the failed metadata blocks in the journal space
    and aborts journaling in the case of jbd2_log_do_checkpoint().
    To achieve this, we need to do:
    
    1. don't remove the failed buffer from the checkpoint list where in
       the case of __try_to_free_cp_buf() because it may be released or
       overwritten by a later transaction
    2. jbd2_log_do_checkpoint() is the last chance, remove the failed
       buffer from the checkpoint list and abort the journal
    3. when checkpointing fails, don't update the journal super block to
       prevent the journaled contents from being cleaned.  For safety,
       don't update j_tail and j_tail_sequence either
    4. when checkpointing fails, notify this error to the ext4 layer so
       that ext4 don't clear the needs_recovery flag, otherwise the
       journaled contents are ignored and cleaned in the recovery phase
    5. if the recovery fails, keep the needs_recovery flag
    6. prevent jbd2_cleanup_journal_tail() from being called between
       __jbd2_journal_drop_transaction() and jbd2_journal_abort()
       (a possible race issue between jbd2_log_do_checkpoint()s called by
       jbd2_journal_flush() and __jbd2_log_wait_for_space())

    jbd2: abort when failed to log metadata buffers
    
    If we failed to write metadata buffers to the journal space and
    succeeded to write the commit record, stale data can be written
    back to the filesystem as metadata in the recovery phase.
    
    To avoid this, when we failed to write out metadata buffers,
    abort the journal before writing the commit record.
    
    We can also avoid this kind of corruption by using the journal
    checksum feature because it can detect invalid metadata blocks in the
    journal and avoid them from being replayed.  So we don't need to care
    about asynchronous commit record writeout with a checksum.

    r8169: shuffle some registers handling around (8168 operation only)
    
    I can not argue strongly for (or against) a specific ordering
    on a purely technical ground but the patch avoids to swallow
    Realtek's changes in one big, hard-to-read gulp.
    
    Let aside the way the RxConfig register is written (see
    rtl_set_rx_tx_config_registers / RxConfig / rtl_set_rx_mode),
    this change brings the registers write ordering closer with
    Realtek's driver one (version 8.006.00) for the 8168 chipsets.
    
    More 8168 specific code which touches the Configx registers will
    be added in the section covered by Cfg9346_UnLock / Cfg9346_Lock.
    
    This code should not be the cause of regression for 810x and
    8110 users.

    ide-generic: handle probing of legacy io-ports v5
    
    Avoid probing the io-ports in case an IDE PCI controller is present and it
    uses the legacy iobases. If we still want to enforce the probing, we do
    
    ide_generic.probe_mask=0x3f
    
    on the kernel command line. The iobase checking code is
    adapted from drivers/ata/pata_legacy.c after converting hex
    pci ids into their corresponding macros in <linux/pci_ids.h>.
    
    Also, check only BAR0/2 resources since those are guaranteed
    by the workaround in drivers/pci/probe.c:pci_setup_device().

    All devices supporting CACHE FLUSH EXT command should also support
    CACHE FLUSH command so it is sufficient to check only for CACHE FLUSH

    ide: /proc/ide/hd*/settings rework
    
    * Add struct ide_devset, S_* flags, *DEVSET() & ide*_devset_*() macros.
    
    * Add 'const struct ide_devset **settings' to ide_driver_t.
    
    * Use 'const struct ide_devset **settings' in ide_drive_t instead of
      'struct ide_settings_s *settings'.  Then convert core code and device
      drivers to use struct ide_devset and co.:
    
      - device settings are no longer allocated dynamically for each device
        but instead there is an unique struct ide_devset instance per setting
    
      - device driver keeps the pointer to the table of pointers to its
        settings in ide_driver_t.settings
    
      - generic settings are kept in ide_generic_setting[]
    
      - ide_proc_[un]register_driver(), ide_find_setting_by_name(),
        ide_{read,write}_setting() and proc_ide_{read,write}_settings()
        are updated accordingly
    
      - ide*_add_settings() are removed
    
    * Remove no longer used __ide_add_setting(), ide_add_setting(),
      __ide_remove_setting() and auto_remove_settings().
    
    * Remove no longer used TYPE_*, SETTING_*, ide_procset_t
      and ide_settings_t.
    
    * ->keep_settings, ->using_dma, ->unmask, ->noflush, ->dsc_overlap,
      ->nice1, ->addressing, ->wcache and ->nowerr ide_drive_t fields
      can now be bitfield flags.
    
    While at it:
    
    * Rename ide_find_setting_by_name() to ide_find_setting().
    
    * Rename write_wcache() to set_wcache().

    ide: preparations for /proc/ide/hd*/settings rework
    
    After rework settings will be no longer created dynamically
    for each device so we need to make some fixups first.
    
    * Use set_[ksettings,unmaskirq]() as a set function for
      ["keepsettings","unmaskirq"] setting.
    
    * Allow writes to ["io_32bit","unmaskirq"] settings also when
      drive->no_[io_32bit,unmask] is set (this is checked later inside
      set_[io_32bit,unmaskirq]() anywyay and keeps consistency with
      the corresponding HDIO_SET_[32BIT,UNMASKINTR] ioctls).
    
    * Use max possible multi sectors value (16) as an allowed max for
      "multcount" setting.  set_multcount() set function checks against
      device's max possbile value anyway and it makes the proc setting
      consistent with the corresponding HDIO_SET_MULTCOUNT ioctl.

    ide: remove drive->driveid
    
    * Factor out HDIO_[OBSOLETE,GET]_IDENTITY ioctls handling
      to ide_get_identity_ioctl().
    
    * Use temporary buffer in ide_get_identity_ioctl() instead
      of accessing drive->id directly.
    
    * Add ide_id_to_hd_driveid() inline to convert raw id into
      struct hd_driveid format (needed on big-endian).
    
    * Use ide_id_to_hd_driveid() in ide_get_identity_ioctl(),
      cleanup ide_fix_driveid() and switch ide to use use raw id.
    
    * Remove no longer needed drive->driveid.
    
      This leaves us with 3 users of struct hd_driveid in tree:

      - drivers/usb/storage/isd200.c

    ide: make drive->id an union (take 2)
    
    Make drive->id an unnamed union so id can be accessed either by using
    'u16 *id' or 'struct hd_driveid *driveid'.  Then convert all existing
    drive->id users accordingly (using 'u16 *id' when possible).
    
    This is an intermediate step to make ide 'struct hd_driveid'-free.

    [S390] 3215: Remove tasklet.
    
    The 3215 console irq handler used to schedule a tasklet. However the
    console irq handler also gets called from the infamous cio_tpi()
    function. Which in turn does something like
    
    local_bh_disable()
    [call console irq handler]
    _local_bh_enable()
    
    _local_bh_enable() prevents execution of softirqs, which is intended
    within cio_tpi(). However there might be a new softirq pending because
    irq handler scheduled a tasklet.
    In order to prevent this behaviour we just get rid of the tasklet.
    It's not doing much anyway.

    [S390] console flush on panic / reboot
    
    The s390 console drivers use the unblank callback of the console
    structure to flush the console buffer. In case of a panic or a
    reboot the CPU doing the callback can block on the console i/o.
    The other CPUs in the system continue to work. For panic this is
    not a good idea.
    
    Replace the unblank callback with proper panic/reboot notifier.
    These get called after all but one CPU have been stopped.

    [S390] cio: Correct use of ! and &
    
    In commit e6bafba5b4765a5a252f1b8d31cbf6d2459da337, a bug was fixed that
    involved converting !x & y to !(x & y).  The code below shows the same
    pattern, and thus should perhaps be fixed in the same way.  In particular,
    the result of !scsw_stctl(&request->irb.scsw) & SCSW_STCTL_STATUS_PEND is
    always just !scsw_stctl(&request->irb.scsw).
    
    The semantic patch that makes this change is as follows:

    [S390] qdio: speed up multicast traffic on full HiperSocket queue
    
    If an asynchronous HiperSockets queue runs full, no further packet
    can be sent. In this case the next initiative to give transmitted
    skbs back to the stack is triggered only by a 10-seconds qdio timer.
    This timer has been introduced for low multicast traffic scenarios
    to guarantee freeing of skbs in a limited amount of time. For high
    HiperSocket multicast traffic scenarios progress checking on the
    outbound queue should be enforced by tasklet rescheduling.

    RPC/RDMA: fix connection IRD/ORD setting
    
    This logic sets the connection parameter that configures the local device
    and informs the remote peer how many concurrent incoming RDMA_READ
    requests are supported. The original logic didn't really do what was
    intended for two reasons:
    
    - The max number supported by the device is typically smaller than
    any one factor in the calculation used, and
    
    - The field in the connection parameter structure where the value is
    stored is a u8 and always overflows for the default settings.
    
    So what really happens is the value requested for responder resources
    is the left over 8 bits from the "desired value". If the desired value
    happened to be a multiple of 256, the result was zero and it wouldn't
    connect at all.
    
    Given the above and the fact that max_requests is almost always larger
    than the max responder resources supported by the adapter, this patch
    simplifies this logic and simply requests the max supported by the device,
    subject to a reasonable limit.
    
    This bug was found by Jim Schutt at Sandia.

    RPC/RDMA: support FRMR client memory registration.
    
    Configure, detect and use "fastreg" support from IB/iWARP verbs
    layer to perform RPC/RDMA memory registration.
    
    Make FRMR the default memreg mode (will fall back if not supported
    by the selected RDMA adapter).
    
    This allows full and optimal operation over the cxgb3 adapter, and others.

    NFS: fix nfs_parse_ip_address() corner case
    
    Bruce observed that nfs_parse_ip_address() will successfully parse an
    IPv6 address that looks like this:
    
      "::1%"
    
    A scope delimiter is present, but there is no scope ID following it.
    This is harmless, as it would simply set the scope ID to zero.  However,
    in some cases we would like to flag this as an improperly formed
    address.
    
    We are now also careful to reject addresses where garbage follows the
    address (up to the length of the string), instead of ignoring the
    non-address characters; and where the scope ID is nonsense (not a valid
    device name, but also not numeric).  Before, both of these cases would
    result in a harmless zero scope ID.

    Fix barrier fail detection in XFS
    
    Currently we disable barriers as soon as we get a buffer in xlog_iodone
    that has the XBF_ORDERED flag cleared.  But this can be the case not only
    for buffers where the barrier failed, but also the first buffer of a
    split log write in case of a log wraparound.  Due to the disabled
    barriers we can easily get directory corruption on unclean shutdowns.
    So instead of using this check add a new buffer flag for failed barrier
    writes.
    
    This is a regression vs 2.6.26 caused by patch to use the right macro
    to check for the ORDERED flag, as we previously got true returned for
    every buffer.
    
    Thanks to Toei Rei for reporting the bug.

    Instead of making init a two pass sequence, to satisfy the Intel's TLB
    Application note (developer.intel.com/design/processor/applnots/317080.pdf
    Section 6 page 26), we preserve the original page permissions
    when fragmenting the large mappings and don't touch the existing memory
    mapping (which satisfies Xen's requirements).
    
    Only open issue is: on a native linux kernel, we will go back to mapping
    the first 0-1GB kernel identity mapping as executable (because of the
    static mapping setup in head_64.S). We can fix this in a different
    patch if needed.

    x86: track memtype for RAM in page struct
    
    Track the memtype for RAM pages in page struct instead of using the
    memtype list. This avoids the explosion in the number of entries in
    memtype list (of the order of 20,000 with AGP) and makes the PAT
    tracking simpler.
    
    We are using PG_arch_1 bit in page->flags.
    
    We still use the memtype list for non RAM pages.

    x86, cpa: srlz cpa(), global flush tlb after splitting big page and before doing cpa
    
    Do a global flush tlb after splitting the large page and before we do the
    actual change page attribute in the PTE.
    
    With out this, we violate the TLB application note, which says
        "The TLBs may contain both ordinary and large-page translations for
         a 4-KByte range of linear addresses. This may occur if software
         modifies the paging structures so that the page size used for the
         address range changes. If the two translations differ with respect
         to page frame or attributes (e.g., permissions), processor behavior
         is undefined and may be implementation-specific."
    
    And also serialize cpa() (for !DEBUG_PAGEALLOC which uses large identity
    mappings) using cpa_lock. So that we don't allow any other cpu, with stale
    large tlb entries change the page attribute in parallel to some other cpu
    splitting a large page entry along with changing the attribute.

    No alias checking needed for setting present/not-present mapping. Otherwise,

    Don't use large pages for kernel identity mapping with DEBUG_PAGEALLOC.
    This will remove the need to split the large page for the

    x86, cpa: make the kernel physical mapping initialization a two pass sequence
    
    In the first pass, kernel physical mapping will be setup using large or
    small pages but uses the same PTE attributes as that of the early
    PTE attributes setup by early boot code in head_[32|64].S
    
    After flushing TLB's, we go through the second pass, which setups the
    direct mapped PTE's with the appropriate attributes (like NX, GLOBAL etc)
    which are runtime detectable.
    
    This two pass mechanism conforms to the TLB app note which says:
    
    "Software should not write to a paging-structure entry in a way that would
     change, for any linear address, both the page size and either the page frame
     or attributes."

    PnP: move pnpacpi/pnpbios_init to after PCI init
    
    We already did that a long time ago for pnp_system_init, but
    pnpacpi_init and pnpbios_init remained as subsys_initcalls, and get
    linked into the kernel before the arch-specific routines that finalize
    the PCI resources (pci_subsys_init).
    
    This means that the PnP routines would either register their resources
    before the PCI layer could, or would be unable to check whether a PCI
    resource had already been registered.  Both are problematic.
    
    I wanted to do this before 2.6.27, but every time we change something
    like this, something breaks.  That said, _every_ single time we trust
    some firmware (like PnP tables) more than we trust the hardware itself
    (like PCI probing), the problems have been worse.

    file.  The first change allows CIPSO to support full LSM labels/contexts,
    not just MLS attributes.  The second change brings the mapping names inline

     * int netlbl_skbuff_setattr(skb, family, secattr)
    
    ... and is designed to be called from a Netfilter hook after the packet's

    netlabel: Replace protocol/NetLabel linking with refrerence counts
    
    NetLabel has always had a list of backpointers in the CIPSO DOI definition
    structure which pointed to the NetLabel LSM domain mapping structures which
    referenced the CIPSO DOI struct.  The rationale for this was that when an
    administrator removed a CIPSO DOI from the system all of the associated
    NetLabel LSM domain mappings should be removed as well; a list of
    backpointers made this a simple operation.
    
    Unfortunately, while the backpointers did make the removal easier they were
    a bit of a mess from an implementation point of view which was making
    further development difficult.  Since the removal of a CIPSO DOI is a
    realtively rare event it seems to make sense to remove this backpointer
    list as the optimization was hurting us more then it was helping.  However,
    we still need to be able to track when a CIPSO DOI definition is being used
    so replace the backpointer list with a reference count.  In order to
    preserve the current functionality of removing the associated LSM domain
    mappings when a CIPSO DOI is removed we walk the LSM domain mapping table,
    removing the relevant entries.

    selinux: Better local/forward check in selinux_ip_postroute()
    
    It turns out that checking to see if skb->sk is NULL is not a very good

    the IP[6]CB(skb)->flags field for the IP[6]SKB_FORWARDED flag.  While we are
    at it, we are calling selinux_parse_skb() much earlier than we really should

    netlabel: Remove unneeded in-kernel API functions
    
    After some discussions with the Smack folks, well just Casey, I now have a
    better idea of what Smack wants out of NetLabel in the future so I think it
    is now safe to do some API "pruning".  If another LSM comes along that
    needs this functionality we can always add it back in, but I don't see any
    LSMs on the horizon which might make use of these functions.
    
    Thanks to Rami Rosen who suggested removing netlbl_cfg_cipsov4_del() back
    in February 2008.

    selinux: Correctly handle IPv4 packets on IPv6 sockets in all cases
    
    We did the right thing in a few cases but there were several areas where we
    determined a packet's address family based on the socket's address family which
    is not the right thing to do since we can get IPv4 packets on IPv6 sockets.
    This patch fixes these problems by either taking the address family directly
    from the packet.

    selinux: Cleanup the NetLabel glue code
    
    We were doing a lot of extra work in selinux_netlbl_sock_graft() what wasn't
    necessary so this patch removes that code.  It also removes the redundant
    second argument to selinux_netlbl_sock_setsid() which allows us to simplify a
    few other functions.

    netlabel: Fix some sparse warnings
    
    Fix a few sparse warnings.  One dealt with a RCU lock being held on error,
    another dealt with an improper type caused by a signed/unsigned mixup while
    the rest appeared to be caused by using rcu_dereference() in a
    list_for_each_entry_rcu() call.  The latter probably isn't a big deal, but
    I derive a certain pleasure from knowing that the net/netlabel is nice and
    clean.
    
    Thanks to James Morris for pointing out the issues and demonstrating how
    to run sparse.

    dm crypt: avoid unnecessary wait when splitting bio
    
    Don't wait between submitting crypt requests for a bio unless
    we are short of memory.
    
    There are two situations when we must split an encrypted bio:
      1) there are no free pages;
      2) the new bio would violate underlying device restrictions
    (e.g. max hw segments).
    
    In case (2) we do not need to wait.

    these cases.

    dm raid1: kcopyd should stop on error if errors handled
    
    dm-raid1 is setting the 'DM_KCOPYD_IGNORE_ERROR' flag unconditionally
    when assigning kcopyd work.  kcopyd is responsible for copying an
    assigned section of disk to one or more other disks.  The
    'DM_KCOPYD_IGNORE_ERROR' flag affects kcopyd in the following way:
    
    When not set:
    kcopyd will immediately stop the copy operation when an error is
    encountered.
    
    When set:
    kcopyd will try to proceed regardless of errors and try to continue
    copying any remaining amount.
    
    Since dm-raid1 tracks regions of the address space that are (or
    are not) in sync and it now has the ability to handle these
    errors, we can safely enable this optimization.  This optimization
    is conditional on whether mirror error handling has been enabled.

    ALSA: ASoC: Check for machine type in GTA01 machine driver
    
    Since there are now multiple OpenMoko platforms it is more important to
    check that the machine driver is running on the correct system.  This
    was orgininally generated as part of the initial GTA02 machine port.

    ALSA: ASoC: add new param mux to dapm_mux_update_power
    
    Function dapm_mux_update_power needs enum index mux and register mask value val
    as parameters, but it only has a parameter val, and uses it as both val and mux.
    snd_soc_test_bits(widget->codec, e->reg, mask, val) val is register mask here,
    e->texts[val] but val should be enum index mux here.
    
    This patch adds a new param mux to fix it.

    ALSA: Increase components array size
    
    Increase the card components[] (and thus snd_card_info.components[],
    too) array size from 80 to 128 chars so that more strings can be
    stored.  The 80 chars aren't enough for more than 2 HD-audio codecs,
    and this hits an ugly snd_BUG() as reported by Wu Fegguang for HP
    2230s.
    
    The control protocol number is increased to 2.0.6 as well, in case
    it matters.

    ALSA: sound/soc/at32: Useless NULL test
    
    The test (ssc != NULL) can only be reached if the call to the function
    ssc_request, the result of which ssc is assigned, succeeds. Moreover,
    two statements assign NULL to ssc just before a return, which is useless
    since it is a local variable. So, we suggest to delete the test and
    the two assignments.
    
    A simplified version of the semantic match that finds this problem is
    as follows:

    // <smpl>
    @bad_null_test@

    xen: do not reserve 2 pages of padding between hypervisor and fixmap.
    
    When reserving space for the hypervisor the Xen paravirt backend adds
    an extra two pages (this was carried forward from the 2.6.18-xen tree
    which had them "for safety"). Depending on various CONFIG options this
    can cause the boot time fixmaps to span multiple PMDs which is not
    supported and triggers a WARN in early_ioremap_init().
    
    This was exposed by 2216d199b1430d1c0affb1498a9ebdbd9c0de439 which
    moved the dmi table parsing earlier.
        x86: fix CONFIG_X86_RESERVE_LOW_64K=y
    
        The bad_bios_dmi_table() quirk never triggered because we do DMI setup
        too late. Move it a bit earlier.
    
    There is no real reason to reserve these two extra pages and the
    fixmap already incorporates FIX_HOLE which serves the same
    purpose. None of the other callers of reserve_top_address do this.

    sched_clock: prevent scd->clock from moving backwards
    
    When sched_clock_cpu() couples the clocks between two cpus, it may
    increment scd->clock beyond the GTOD tick window that __update_sched_clock()
    uses to clamp the clock.  A later call to __update_sched_clock() may move
    the clock back to scd->tick_gtod + TICK_NSEC, violating the clock's
    monotonic property.
    
    This patch ensures that scd->clock will not be set backward.

    powerpc: Reserve in bootmem lmb reserved regions that cross NUMA nodes
    
    If there are multiple reserved memory blocks via lmb_reserve() that are
    contiguous addresses and on different NUMA nodes we are losing track of which
    address ranges to reserve in bootmem on which node.  I discovered this
    when I recently got to try 16GB huge pages on a system with more then 2 nodes.
    
    When scanning the device tree in early boot we call lmb_reserve() with
    the addresses of the 16G pages that we find so that the memory doesn't
    get used for something else.  For example the addresses for the pages
    could be 4000000000, 4400000000, 4800000000, 4C00000000, etc - 8 pages,
    one on each of eight nodes.  In the lmb after all the pages have been
    reserved it will look something like the following:
    
    lmb_dump_all:
        memory.cnt            = 0x2
        memory.size           = 0x3e80000000
        memory.region[0x0].base       = 0x0
                          .size     = 0x1e80000000
        memory.region[0x1].base       = 0x4000000000
                          .size     = 0x2000000000
        reserved.cnt          = 0x5
        reserved.size         = 0x3e80000000
        reserved.region[0x0].base       = 0x0
                          .size     = 0x7b5000
        reserved.region[0x1].base       = 0x2a00000
                          .size     = 0x78c000
        reserved.region[0x2].base       = 0x328c000
                          .size     = 0x43000
        reserved.region[0x3].base       = 0xf4e8000
                          .size     = 0xb18000
        reserved.region[0x4].base       = 0x4000000000
                          .size     = 0x2000000000
    
    The reserved.region[0x4] contains the 16G pages.  In
    arch/powerpc/mm/num.c: do_init_bootmem() we loop through each of the
    node numbers looking for the reserved regions that belong to the
    particular node.  It is not able to identify region 0x4 as being a part
    of each of the 8 nodes.  It is assuming that a reserved region is only
    on a single node.
    
    This patch takes out the reserved region loop from inside
    the loop that goes over each node.  It looks up the active region containing
    the start of the reserved region.  If it extends past that active region then
    it adjusts the size and gets the next active region containing it.

    powerpc: Sync RPA note in zImage with kernel's RPA note
    
    Commit 9b09c6d909dfd8de96b99b9b9c808b94b0a71614 ("powerpc: Change the
    default link address for pSeries zImage kernels") changed the
    real-base value in the CHRP note added by the addnote program from
    12MB to 32MB to give more space for Open Firmware to load the zImage.
    (The real-base value says where we want OF to position itself in
    memory.)  However, this change was ineffective on most pSeries
    machines, because the RPA note added by addnote has the "ignore me"
    flag set to 1.  This was intended to tell OF to ignore just the RPA
    note, but has the side effect of also making OF ignore the CHRP note
    (at least on most pSeries machines).
    
    To solve this we have to set the "ignore me" flag to 0 in the RPA
    note.  (We can't just omit the RPA note because that is equivalent to
    having an RPA note with default values, and the default values are not
    what we want.)  However, then we have to make sure the values in the
    zImage's RPA note match up with the values that the kernel supplies
    later in prom_init.c with either the ibm,client-architecture-support
    call or the process-elf-header call in prom_send_capabilities().
    
    So this sets the "ignore me" flag in the RPA note in addnote to 0, and
    adjusts the RPA note values in addnote.c and in prom_init.c to be
    consistent with each other and with the values in ibm_architecture_vec.
    
    However, since the wrapper is independent of the kernel, this doesn't
    ensure that the notes will stay consistent.  To ensure that, this adds
    code to addnote.c so that it can extract the kernel's RPA note from
    the kernel binary and put that in the zImage.  To that end, we put the
    kernel's fake ELF header (which contains the kernel's RPA note) into
    its own section, and arrange for wrapper to pull out that section with
    objcopy and pass it to addnote, which then extracts the RPA note from
    it and transfers it to the zImage.

    [PATCH] signal, procfs: some lock_task_sighand() users do not need rcu_read_lock()
    
    lock_task_sighand() make sure task->sighand is being protected,
    so we do not need rcu_read_lock().
    [ exec() will get task->sighand->siglock before change task->sighand! ]
    
    But code using rcu_read_lock() _just_ to protect lock_task_sighand()
    only appear in procfs. (and some code in procfs use lock_task_sighand()
    without such redundant protection.)
    
    Other subsystem may put lock_task_sighand() into rcu_read_lock()
    critical region, but these rcu_read_lock() are used for protecting
    "for_each_process()", "find_task_by_vpid()" etc. , not for protecting
    lock_task_sighand().

    (IPV6/IPV4) and not looking at bound addresses if any.
    
    We should perform same tests than when binding to a
    specific port.

    tcpv[46]: fix md5 pseudoheader address field ordering
    
    Maybe it's just me but I guess those md5 people made a mess
    out of it by having *_md5_hash_* to use daddr, saddr order
    instead of the one that is natural (and equal to what csum
    functions use). For the segment were sending, the original
    addresses are reversed so buff's saddr == skb's daddr and
    vice-versa.
    
    Maybe I can finally proceed with unification of some code
    after fixing it first... :-)

    e1000: don't generate bad checksums for tcp packets with 0 csum
    
    When offloading transmit checksums only, the driver was not
    correctly configuring the hardware to handle the case of a zero
    checksum.  For UDP the correct behavior is to leave it alone, but
    for tcp the checksum must be changed from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF.  The
    hardware takes care of this case but only if it is told the
    packet is tcp.

    e1000e: don't generate bad checksums for tcp packets with 0 csum
    
    When offloading transmit checksums only, the driver was not
    correctly configuring the hardware to handle the case of a zero
    checksum.  For UDP the correct behavior is to leave it alone, but
    for tcp the checksum must be changed from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF.  The
    hardware takes care of this case but only if it is told the
    packet is tcp.

    [ARM] 5295/1: make ZONE_DMA optional
    
    Most ARM machines don't need a special "DMA" memory zone, and
    when configured out, the kernel becomes a bit smaller:
    
    |   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
    |3826182  102384  111700 4040266  3da64a vmlinux
    |3823593  101616  111700 4036909  3d992d vmlinux.nodmazone
    
    This is because the system now has only one zone total which effect is
    to optimize away many conditionals in page allocation paths.
    
    So let's configure this zone only on machines that need split zones.

    inet: Make tunnel RX/TX byte counters more consistent
    
    This patch makes the RX/TX byte counters for IPIP, GRE and SIT more
    consistent.  Previously we included the external IP headers on the
    way out but not when the packet is inbound.
    
    The new scheme is to count payload only in both directions.  For
    IPIP and SIT this simply means the exclusion of the external IP
    header.  For GRE this means that we exclude the GRE header as
    well.

    gre: Add Transparent Ethernet Bridging
    
    This patch adds support for Ethernet over GRE encapsulation.
    This is exposed to user-space with a new link type of "gretap"
    instead of "gre".  It will create an ARPHRD_ETHER device in
    lieu of the usual ARPHRD_IPGRE.
    
    Note that to preserver backwards compatibility all Transparent
    Ethernet Bridging packets are passed to an ARPHRD_IPGRE tunnel
    if its key matches and there is no ARPHRD_ETHER device whose
    key matches more closely.

    This patch adds a netlink interface that will eventually displace

    This also means that user-space no longer needs to rely on the
    tunnel interface being of type GRE to identify GRE tunnels.  The
    identification can now occur using rtnl_link_ops.

    This patch moves the dev->mtu setting out of ipgre_tunnel_bind_dev.
    This is in prepartion of using rtnl_link where we'll need to make
    the MTU setting conditional on whether the user has supplied an
    MTU.  This also requires the move of the ipgre_tunnel_bind_dev
    call out of the dev->init function so that we can access the user
    parameters later.

    Now that we have dev->needed_headroom, we can use it instead of

    include dev->hard_header_len in the MTU computation so that when
    we do have a meaningful hard_harder_len in future it is included
    automatically in figuring out the MTU.
    
    Incidentally, this fixes a bug where we ignored the needed_headroom
    field of the underlying device in calculating our own hard_header_len.

    NFS: Fix attribute updates
    
    This fixes a regression seen when running the Connectathon testsuite
    against an ext3 filesystem. The reason was that the inode was constantly
    being marked as 'just updated' by the jiffy wraparound test.
    This again meant that newer GETATTR calls were failing to pass the
    nfs_inode_attrs_need_update() test unless the changes caused a ctime update
    on the server, since they were perceived as having been started before the
    latest inode update.
    
    Given that nfs_inode_attrs_need_update() already checks for wraparound
    of nfsi->last_updated, we can drop the buggy "protection" in
    nfs_update_inode().
    
    Also make a slight micro-optimisation of nfs_inode_attrs_need_update(): we
    are more often going to see time_after(fattr->time_start, nfsi->last_updated)
    be true, rather than seeing an update of ctime/size, so put that test
    first to ensure that we optimise away the ctime/size tests.

    phylib: two dynamic mii_bus allocation fallout fixes
    
    1. arch/powerpc/platforms/pasemi/gpio_mdio.c also needs to be
       converted over to mdiobus_{alloc,free}().
    
    2. drivers/net/phy/fixed.c used to embed a struct mii_bus into its
       struct fixed_mdio_bus and then use container_of() to go from the
       former to the latter.  Since mii bus structures are no longer
       embedded, we need to do something like use the mii bus private
       pointer to go from mii_bus to fixed_mdio_bus instead.

    - Remove unused sram.c functions for 34xx
    
    - Rename IRQ_SIR_IRQ to INTCPS_SIR_IRQ and define it locally
      in entry-macro.S
    
    - Update mach-omap2/io.c to support 2420, 2430, and 34xx
    
    - Also merge in 34xx GPMC changes to add fields wr_access and
      wr_data_mux_bus from Adrian Hunter
    
    - Remove memory initialization call omap2_init_memory() until
      until more generic memory initialization patches are posted.

    xen: use spin_lock_nest_lock when pinning a pagetable
    
    When pinning/unpinning a pagetable with split pte locks, we can end up
    holding multiple pte locks at once (we need to hold the locks while
    there's a pending batched hypercall affecting the pte page).  Because
    all the pte locks are in the same lock class, lockdep thinks that
    we're potentially taking a lock recursively.
    
    This warning is spurious because we always take the pte locks while
    holding mm->page_table_lock.  lockdep now has spin_lock_nest_lock to
    express this kind of dominant lock use, so use it here so that lockdep
    knows what's going on.

    then the mempool_t parameter can be removed from bio_split param list, and
    bio_split_pool is only referred in fs/bio.c file, can be marked static.

    block: add lld busy state exporting interface
    
    This patch adds an new interface, blk_lld_busy(), to check lld's
    busy state from the block layer.
    blk_lld_busy() calls down into low-level drivers for the checking
    if the drivers set q->lld_busy_fn() using blk_queue_lld_busy().
    
    This resolves a performance problem on request stacking devices below.
    
    Some drivers like scsi mid layer stop dispatching request when
    they detect busy state on its low-level device like host/target/device.
    It allows other requests to stay in the I/O scheduler's queue
    for a chance of merging.
    
    Request stacking drivers like request-based dm should follow
    the same logic.
    However, there is no generic interface for the stacked device
    to check if the underlying device(s) are busy.
    If the request stacking driver dispatches and submits requests to
    the busy underlying device, the requests will stay in
    the underlying device's queue without a chance of merging.
    This causes performance problem on burst I/O load.
    
    With this patch, busy state of the underlying device is exported
    via q->lld_busy_fn().  So the request stacking driver can check it
    and stop dispatching requests if busy.
    
    The underlying device driver must return the busy state appropriately:
        1: when the device driver can't process requests immediately.
        0: when the device driver can process requests immediately,
           including abnormal situations where the device driver needs
           to kill all requests.

    by the patch below yet. A few more cleanups would be needed.
    For example, the blktrace ioctl numbers, which are currently defined in

    floppy: support arbitrary first-sector numbers
    
    The current floppy_struct allows floppies to number sectors starting
    from 0 or 1.  This patch allows arbitrary first-sector numbers - for
    example, 0xC1 for Amstrad CPC disks.
    
    This extends the existing 1-bit field (FD_ZEROBASED, bit 2 of stretch)
    to 8 bits (FD_SECTMASK, bits 2 to 9).
    
    Currently 0x00 denotes a first sector number of 1, and 0x01 denotes a
    first sector number of 0.  We extend this by interpreting FD_SECTMASK
    as the first sector number with the LSB flipped.

    block: add a queue flag for request stacking support
    
    This patch adds a queue flag to indicate the block device can be
    used for request stacking.
    
    Request stacking drivers need to stack their devices on top of
    only devices of which q->request_fn is functional.
    Since bio stacking drivers (e.g. md, loop) basically initialize
    their queue using blk_alloc_queue() and don't set q->request_fn,
    the check of (q->request_fn == NULL) looks enough for that purpose.
    
    However, dm will become both types of stacking driver (bio-based and
    request-based).  And dm will always set q->request_fn even if the dm
    device is bio-based of which q->request_fn is not functional actually.
    So we need something else to distinguish the type of the device.
    Adding a queue flag is a solution for that.
    
    The reason why dm always sets q->request_fn is to keep
    the compatibility of dm user-space tools.
    Currently, all dm user-space tools are using bio-based dm without
    specifying the type of the dm device they use.
    To use request-based dm without changing such tools, the kernel
    must decide the type of the dm device automatically.
    The automatic type decision can't be done at the device creation time
    and needs to be deferred until such tools load a mapping table,
    since the actual type is decided by dm target type included in
    the mapping table.
    
    So a dm device has to be initialized using blk_init_queue()
    so that we can load either type of table.
    Then, all queue stuffs are set (e.g. q->request_fn) and we have
    no element to distinguish that it is bio-based or request-based,
    even after a table is loaded and the type of the device is decided.
    
    By the way, some stuffs of the queue (e.g. request_list, elevator)
    are needless when the dm device is used as bio-based.
    But the memory size is not so large (about 20[KB] per queue on ia64),
    so I hope the memory loss can be acceptable for bio-based dm users.

    block: add request submission interface
    
    This patch adds blk_insert_cloned_request(), a generic request
    submission interface for request stacking drivers.
    Request-based dm will use it to submit their clones to underlying
    devices.
    
    blk_rq_check_limits() is also added because it is possible that
    the lower queue has stronger limitations than the upper queue
    if multiple drivers are stacking at request-level.
    Not only for blk_insert_cloned_request()'s internal use, the function
    will be used by request-based dm when the queue limitation is
    modified (e.g. by replacing dm's table).

    block: add request update interface
    
    This patch adds blk_update_request(), which updates struct request
    with completing its data part, but doesn't complete the struct
    request itself.
    Though it looks like end_that_request_first() of older kernels,
    blk_update_request() should be used only by request stacking drivers.
    
    Request-based dm will use it in bio->bi_end_io callback to update
    the original request when a data part of a cloned request completes.
    Followings are additional background information of why request-based
    dm needs this interface.
    
      - Request stacking drivers can't use blk_end_request() directly from
        the lower driver's completion context (bio->bi_end_io or rq->end_io),
        because some device drivers (e.g. ide) may try to complete
        their request with queue lock held, and it may cause deadlock.
        See below for detailed description of possible deadlock:
        <http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=120311479108569&w=2>
    
      - To solve that, request-based dm offloads the completion of
        cloned struct request to softirq context (i.e. using
        blk_complete_request() from rq->end_io).
    
      - Though it is possible to use the same solution from bio->bi_end_io,
        it will delay the notification of bio completion to the original
        submitter.  Also, it will cause inefficient partial completion,
        because the lower driver can't perform the cloned request anymore
        and request-based dm needs to requeue and redispatch it to
        the lower driver again later.  That's not good.
    
      - So request-based dm needs blk_update_request() to perform the bio
        completion in the lower driver's completion context, which is more
        efficient.

    block: blk_cleanup_queue() should call blk_sync_queue()
    
    When a driver calls blk_cleanup_queue(), the device should be fully idle.
    However, the block layer may have pending plugging timers and the IO
    schedulers may have pending work in the work queues. So quisce the device
    by waiting for the timer and flushing the work queues.

    block: Expand Xen blkfront for > 16 xvd
    
    Until recently, the maximum number of xvd block devices you could attach
    to a Xen domU was 16. This limitation turned out to be problematic for
    some users, so it was expanded to handle a much larger number of disks.
    However, this requires a couple of changes in the way that blkfront
    scans for disks. This functionality is already present in the Xen
    linux-2.6.18-xen.hg tree; the attached patch adds this functionality to
    the mainline xen-blkfront implementation. I successfully tested it on a
    2.6.25 tree, and build tested it on 2.6.27-rc3.

    Two mods to blkdev_issue_discard(), thinking ahead to its use on swap:
    
    1. Add gfp_mask argument, so swap allocation can use it where GFP_KERNEL
       might deadlock but GFP_NOIO is safe.
    
    2. Enlarge nr_sects argument from unsigned to sector_t: unsigned long is
       enough to cover a whole swap area, but sector_t suits any partition.
    
    Change sb_issue_discard()'s nr_blocks to sector_t too; but no need seen

    Call flush_disk() after detecting an online resize.
    
    We call flush_disk() to make sure the buffer cache for the disk is
    flushed after a disk resize. There are two resize cases, growing and
    shrinking. Given that users can shrink/then grow a disk before
    revalidate_disk() is called, we treat the grow case identically to
    shrinking. We need to flush the buffer cache after an online shrink
    because, as James Bottomley puts it,
    
         The two use cases for shrinking I can see are
    
         1. planned: the fs is already shrunk to within the new boundaries
            and all data is relocated, so invalidate is fine (any dirty
            buffers that might exist in the shrunk region are there only
            because they were relocated but not yet written to their
            original location).
         2. unplanned:  In this case, the fs is probably toast, so whether
            we invalidate or not isn't going to make a whole lot of
            difference; it's still going to try to read or write from
            sectors beyond the new size and get I/O errors.
    
    Immediately invalidating shrunk disks will cause errors for outstanding
    I/Os for reads/write beyond the new end of the disk to be generated
    earlier then if we waited for the normal buffer cache operation. It also
    removes a potential security hole where we might keep old data around
    from beyond the end of the shrunk disk if the disk was not invalidated.

    block: don't test for partition size in bdget_disk() and blk_lookup_devt()
    
    bdget_disk() and blk_lookup_devt() never cared whether the specified
    partition (or disk) is zero sized or not.  I got confused while
    converting those not to depend on consecutive minor numbers in commit
    5a6411b1178baf534aa9138052864dfa89d3eada and later when dev0 was added
    it broke callers which expected to get valid return for zero sized
    disk devices.
    
    So, they never needed nr_sects checks in the first place.  Kill them.
    
    This problem was spotted and debugged by Bartlmoiej Zolnierkiewicz.

    It's a debug option that you would explicitly enable to test this
    feature, we should default it to 'n' to prevent accidental surprises

    cfq-iosched: fix queue depth detection
    
    CFQ's detection of queueing devices assumes a non-queuing device and detects
    if the queue depth reaches a certain threshold.  Under some workloads (e.g.
    synchronous reads), CFQ effectively forces a unit queue depth, thus defeating
    the detection logic.  This leads to poor performance on queuing hardware,
    since the idle window remains enabled.
    
    This patch inverts the sense of the logic: assume a queuing-capable device,
    and detect if the depth does not exceed the threshold.

    block: add support for IO CPU affinity
    
    This patch adds support for controlling the IO completion CPU of
    either all requests on a queue, or on a per-request basis. We export
    a sysfs variable (rq_affinity) which, if set, migrates completions
    of requests to the CPU that originally submitted it. A bio helper
    (bio_set_completion_cpu()) is also added, so that queuers can ask
    for completion on that specific CPU.
    
    In testing, this has been show to cut the system time by as much
    as 20-40% on synthetic workloads where CPU affinity is desired.
    
    This requires a little help from the architecture, so it'll only
    work as designed for archs that are using the new generic smp
    helper infrastructure.

    block: allow disk to have extended device number
    
    Now that disk and partition handlings are mostly unified, it's easy to
    allow disk to have extended device number.  This patch makes
    add_disk() use extended device number if disk->minors is zero.  Both
    sd and ide-disk are updated to use this.
    
    * sd_format_disk_name() is implemented which can generically determine
      the drive name.  This removes disk number restriction stemming from
      limited device names.
    
    * If sd index goes over SD_MAX_DISKS (which can be increased now BTW),
      sd simply doesn't initialize minors letting block layer choose
      extended device number.
    
    * If CONFIG_DEBUG_EXT_DEVT is set, both sd and ide-disk always set
      minors to 0 and use extended device numbers.

    With previous changes, it's meaningless to limit the number of

    This kills not-too-pretty alloc_disk_ext[_node]() functions and makes

    good number of common fields and thus separate code paths doing the
    same thing.  Also, the partition array was indexed by partno - 1 which
    gets pretty confusing at times.
    
    This patch introduces partition 0 and makes the partition array
    indexed by partno.  Following patches will unify the handling of disk
    and parts piece-by-piece.
    
    This patch also implements disk_partitionable() which tests whether a
    disk is partitionable.  With coming dynamic partition array change,
    the most common usage of disk_max_parts() will be testing whether a
    disk is partitionable and the number of max partitions will become
    much less important.

    block: implement extended dev numbers
    
    Implement extended device numbers.  A block driver can tell block
    layer that it wants to use extended device numbers.  After the usual
    minor space is used up, block layer automatically allocates devt's
    from EXT_BLOCK_MAJOR.
    
    Currently only one major number is allocated for this but as the
    allocation is strictly on-demand, ~1mil minor space under it should
    suffice unless the system actually has more than ~1mil partitions and
    if that ever happens adding more majors to the extended devt area is
    easy.
    
    Due to internal implementation issues, the first partition can't be
    allocated on the extended area.  In other words, genhd->minors should
    at least be 1.  This limitation will be lifted by later changes.

    block: fix diskstats access
    
    There are two variants of stat functions - ones prefixed with double
    underbars which don't care about preemption and ones without which
    disable preemption before manipulating per-cpu counters.  It's unclear
    whether the underbarred ones assume that preemtion is disabled on
    entry as some callers don't do that.
    
    This patch unifies diskstats access by implementing disk_stat_lock()
    and disk_stat_unlock() which take care of both RCU (for partition
    access) and preemption (for per-cpu counter access).  diskstats access
    should always be enclosed between the two functions.  As such, there's
    no need for the versions which disables preemption.  They're removed
    and double underbars ones are renamed to drop the underbars.  As an
    extra argument is added, there's no danger of using the old version
    unconverted.
    
    disk_stat_lock() uses get_cpu() and returns the cpu index and all
    diskstat functions which access per-cpu counters now has @cpu
    argument to help RT.
    
    This change adds RCU or preemption operations at some places but also
    collapses several preemption ops into one at others.  Overall, the
    performance difference should be negligible as all involved ops are
    very lightweight per-cpu ones.

    block: fix disk->part[] dereferencing race
    
    disk->part[] is protected by its matching bdev's lock.  However,
    non-critical accesses like collecting stats and printing out sysfs and
    proc information used to be performed without any locking.  As
    partitions can come and go dynamically, partitions can go away
    underneath those non-critical accesses.  As some of those accesses are
    writes, this theoretically can lead to silent corruption.
    
    This patch fixes the race by using RCU for the partition array and dev
    reference counter to hold partitions.
    
    * Rename disk->part[] to disk->__part[] to make sure no one outside
      genhd layer proper accesses it directly.
    
    * Use RCU for disk->__part[] dereferencing.
    
    * Implement disk_{get|put}_part() which can be used to get and put
      partitions from gendisk respectively.
    
    * Iterators are implemented to help iterate through all partitions
      safely.
    
    * Functions which require RCU readlock are marked with _rcu suffix.
    
    * Use disk_put_part() in __blkdev_put() instead of directly putting
      the contained kobject.

      ->major and ->first_minor will continue to represent devt for the
      disk, converting these users aren't strictly necessary.  However,
      convert them for consistency.

    Iterating over entries using callback usually isn't too fun especially
    when the entry being iterated over can't be manipulated freely.  This
    patch converts class->p->class_devices to klist and implements class

    structure.  The users are also free to call back into class code
    without worrying about locking.
    
    class_for_each_device() and class_find_device() are converted to use
    the new iterators, so their users don't have to worry about locking
    anymore either.
    
    Note: This depends on klist-dont-iterate-over-deleted-entries patch

    klist: don't iterate over deleted entries
    
    A klist entry is kept on the list till all its current iterations are
    finished; however, a new iteration after deletion also iterates over
    deleted entries as long as their reference count stays above zero.
    This causes problems for cases where there are users which iterate
    over the list while synchronized against list manipulations and
    natuarally expect already deleted entries to not show up during
    iteration.
    
    This patch implements dead flag which gets set on deletion so that
    iteration can skip already deleted entries.  The dead flag piggy backs
    on the lowest bit of knode->n_klist and only visible to klist
    implementation proper.
    
    While at it, drop klist_iter->i_head as it's redundant and doesn't
    offer anything in semantics or performance wise as klist_iter->i_klist
    is dereferenced on every iteration anyway.

    struct request has an ioprio member but it is never updated because
    currently bios do not hold io context information. The implication of
    this is that virtio_blk ends up passing useless information to the
    backend driver.
    
    That said, some IO schedulers such as CFQ do store io context
    information in struct request, but use private members for that, which
    means that that information cannot be directly accessed in a IO
    scheduler-independent way.
    
    This patch adds a function to obtain the ioprio of a request. We should
    avoid accessing ioprio directly and use this function instead, so that
    its users do not have to care about future changes in block layer
    structures or what the currently active IO controller is.
    
    This patch does not introduce any functional changes but paves the way
    for future clean-ups and enhancements.

    Allow elevators to sort/merge discard requests
    
    But blkdev_issue_discard() still emits requests which are interpreted as
    soft barriers, because naïve callers might otherwise issue subsequent
    writes to those same sectors, which might cross on the queue (if they're
    reallocated quickly enough).
    
    Callers still _can_ issue non-barrier discard requests, but they have to
    take care of queue ordering for themselves.

    Add BLKDISCARD ioctl to allow userspace to discard sectors
    
    We may well want mkfs tools to use this to mark the whole device as
    unwanted before they format it, for example.
    
    The ioctl takes a pair of uint64_ts, which are start offset and length
    in _bytes_. Although at the moment it might make sense for them both to
    be in 512-byte sectors, I don't want to limit the ABI to that.

    Add 'discard' request handling
    
    Some block devices benefit from a hint that they can forget the contents
    of certain sectors. Add basic support for this to the block core, along
    with a 'blkdev_issue_discard()' helper function which issues such
    requests.
    
    The caller doesn't get to provide an end_io functio, since
    blkdev_issue_discard() will automatically split the request up into
    multiple bios if appropriate. Neither does the function wait for
    completion -- it's expected that callers won't care about when, or even
    _if_, the request completes. It's only a hint to the device anyway. By
    definition, the file system doesn't _care_ about these sectors any more.

    SG_IO block filter whitelist missing MMC SET READ AHEAD command
    
    I have another request for the block filter SG_IO command whitelist,
    specifically the MMC streaming command set SET READ AHEAD command.
    The command applies only to MMC CDROM/DVDROM drives with the streaming
    optional feature set.  The command is useful to cdparanoia in that it
    allows explicit cache control side effects that are, on many drives,
    cdparanoia's most efficient way to flush/disable the media cache on
    cdrom drives. I am aware of no reason why it should not be accessible
    from usespace.
    
    Also note that the command is already fully accessible through the
    SCSI-native version of the SG_IO ioctl as well as the traditional SG
    interface.  The command is only being refused on block devices.  That
    means that on a typical stock distro, the command is available through
    /dev/sg* but not /dev/scd* although both are typically available and
    accessible.  Filtering the command is not providing any protection,
    only a confusing inconsistency.

    cxgb3: More flexible support for PHY interrupts.
    
    Do not require PHY interrupts to be connected to GPIs in ascending order.
    Base interrupt availability both on PHYs supporting them and on GPIs being
    hooked up.  Allows boards to specify interrupt GPIs though the PHYs don't
    use them.
    
    Remove spurious PHY interrupts due to clearing T3DBG interrupts before
    setting their polarity.

    dsa: add support for the Marvell 88E6131 switch chip
    
    Add support for the Marvell 88E6131 switch chip.  This chip only
    supports the original (ethertype-less) DSA tagging format.
    
    On the 88E6131, there is a PHY Polling Unit (PPU) which has exclusive
    access to each of the PHYs's MII management registers.  If we want to
    talk to the PHYs from software, we have to disable the PPU and wait
    for it to complete its current transaction before we can do so, and we
    need to re-enable the PPU afterwards to make sure that the switch will
    notice changes in link state and speed on the individual ports as they
    occur.
    
    Since disabling the PPU is rather slow, and since MII management
    accesses are typically done in bursts, this patch keeps the PPU disabled
    for 10ms after a software access completes.  This makes handling the
    PPU slightly more complex, but speeds up something like running ethtool
    on one of the switch slave interfaces from ~300ms to ~30ms on typical
    hardware.

    dsa: add support for original DSA tagging format
    
    Most of the DSA switches currently in the field do not support the
    Ethertype DSA tagging format that one of the previous patches added
    support for, but only the original DSA tagging format.
    
    The original DSA tagging format carries the same information as the
    Ethertype DSA tagging format, but with the difference that it does not
    have an ethertype field.  In other words, when receiving a packet that
    is tagged with an original DSA tag, there is no way of telling in
    eth_type_trans() that this packet is in fact a DSA-tagged packet.
    
    This patch adds a hook into eth_type_trans() which is only compiled in
    if support for a switch chip that doesn't support Ethertype DSA is
    selected, and which checks whether there is a DSA switch driver
    instance attached to this network device which uses the old tag format.
    If so, it sets the protocol field to ETH_P_DSA without looking at the
    packet, so that the packet ends up in the right place.

    net: Distributed Switch Architecture protocol support
    
    Distributed Switch Architecture is a protocol for managing hardware
    switch chips.  It consists of a set of MII management registers and
    commands to configure the switch, and an ethernet header format to
    signal which of the ports of the switch a packet was received from
    or is intended to be sent to.
    
    The switches that this driver supports are typically embedded in
    access points and routers, and a typical setup with a DSA switch
    looks something like this:
    
    	+-----------+       +-----------+
    	|           | RGMII |           |
    	|           +-------+           +------ 1000baseT MDI ("WAN")
    	|           |       |  6-port   +------ 1000baseT MDI ("LAN1")
    	|    CPU    |       |  ethernet +------ 1000baseT MDI ("LAN2")
    	|           |MIImgmt|  switch   +------ 1000baseT MDI ("LAN3")
    	|           +-------+  w/5 PHYs +------ 1000baseT MDI ("LAN4")
    	|           |       |           |
    	+-----------+       +-----------+
    
    The switch driver presents each port on the switch as a separate
    network interface to Linux, polls the switch to maintain software
    link state of those ports, forwards MII management interface
    accesses to those network interfaces (e.g. as done by ethtool) to
    the switch, and exposes the switch's hardware statistics counters
    via the appropriate Linux kernel interfaces.
    
    This initial patch supports the MII management interface register
    layout of the Marvell 88E6123, 88E6161 and 88E6165 switch chips, and
    supports the "Ethertype DSA" packet tagging format.
    
    (There is no officially registered ethertype for the Ethertype DSA
    packet format, so we just grab a random one.  The ethertype to use
    is programmed into the switch, and the switch driver uses the value
    of ETH_P_EDSA for this, so this define can be changed at any time in
    the future if the one we chose is allocated to another protocol or
    if Ethertype DSA gets its own officially registered ethertype, and
    everything will continue to work.)

    gianfar: Create net device with carrier down
    
    The device's carrier status is controlled via the functions
    netif_carrier_on() and netif_carrier_off().  These set or clear a bit
    indicating the carrier (aka lower level link) is down, and if the state
    changed, they fire off a routing netlink event.
    
    Add a call to netif_carrier_off() before register_netdev() so that the
    newly created device will be set to carrier down.  Then when the carrier
    comes up for the first time, a netlink event will be generated, as the
    carrier changed from down to up.  Otherwise the initial carrier up will
    appear to be changing the status from up to up, and so no event is
    generated since that's not a change.

    Remove the EXPERIMENTAL label from the atl1 driver and change the vendor

    net: remove LLTX in atl2 driver
    
    When NETIF_F_LLTX is set, the atlx driver will use a private lock.
    But in recent kernels this implementation seems redundant and
    can cause problems where AF_PACKET sees things twice. Since
    NETIF_F_LLTX is marked as deprecated and shouldn't be used in
    new driver, this patch removes NETIF_F_LLTX and adds a mmiowb
    before sending packet. I have tested this driver on a Eee PC.
    It works well.

    PHY: Avoid unnecessary aneg restarts
    
    The PHY's aneg is configured and restarted whenever the link is brought up,
    e.g. when DHCP is started after the kernel has booted.  This can take the
    link down for several seconds while auto-negotiation is redone.
    
    If the advertised features haven't changed, then it shouldn't be necessary
    to bring down the link and start auto-negotiation over again.
    
    genphy_config_advert() is enhanced to return 0 when the advertised features
    haven't been changed and >0 when they have been.
    
    genphy_config_aneg() then uses this information to not call
    genphy_restart_aneg() if there has been no change.

    sctp: Rework the tsn map to use generic bitmap.
    
    The tsn map currently use is 4K large and is stuck inside
    the sctp_association structure making memory references REALLY
    expensive.  What we really need is at most 4K worth of bits
    so the biggest map we would have is 512 bytes.   Also, the
    map is only really usefull when we have gaps to store and
    report.  As such, starting with minimal map of say 32 TSNs (bits)
    should be enough for normal low-loss operations.  We can grow
    the map by some multiple of 32 along with some extra room any
    time we receive the TSN which would put us outside of the map
    boundry.  As we close gaps, we can shift the map to rebase
    it on the latest TSN we've seen.  This saves 4088 bytes per
    association just in the map alone along savings from the now
    unnecessary structure members.

    inet: cleanup of local_port_range
    
    I noticed sysctl_local_port_range[] and its associated seqlock
    sysctl_local_port_range_lock were on separate cache lines.
    Moreover, sysctl_local_port_range[] was close to unrelated
    variables, highly modified, leading to cache misses.
    
    Moving these two variables in a structure can help data
    locality and moving this structure to read_mostly section
    helps sharing of this data among cpus.
    
    Cleanup of extern declarations (moved in include file where
    they belong), and use of inet_get_local_port_range()
    accessor instead of direct access to ports values.

    udp: Improve port randomization
    
    Current UDP port allocation is suboptimal.
    We select the shortest chain to chose a port (out of 512)
    that will hash in this shortest chain.
    
    First, it can lead to give not so ramdom ports and ease
    give attackers more opportunities to break the system.
    
    Second, it can consume a lot of CPU to scan all table
    in order to find the shortest chain.
    
    Third, in some pathological cases we can fail to find
    a free port even if they are plenty of them.
    
    This patch zap the search for a short chain and only
    use one random seed. Problem of getting long chains
    should be addressed in another way, since we can
    obtain long chains with non random ports.
    
    Based on a report and patch from Vitaly Mayatskikh

    pkt_sched: Update qdisc requeue stats in dev_requeue_skb()
    
    After the last change of requeuing there is no info about such
    incidents in tc stats. This patch updates the counter, but we should
    consider this should differ from previous stats because of additional
    checks preventing to repeat this. On the other hand, previous stats
    didn't include requeuing of gso_segmented skbs.

    tcp: fix length used for checksum in a reset
    
    While looking for some common code I came across difference
    in checksum calculation between tcp_v6_send_(reset|ack) I
    couldn't explain. I checked both v4 and v6 and found out that
    both seem to have the same "feature". I couldn't find anything
    in rfc nor anywhere else which would state that md5 option
    should be ignored like it was in case of reset so I came to
    a conclusion that this is probably a genuine bug. I suspect
    that addition of md5 just was fooled by the excessive
    copy-paste code in those functions and the reset part was
    never tested well enough to find out the problem.

    it doesn't fit in the I2C ID's 20 characters limit. The limit won't

    MCUs.

    This patch suppresses I2C device probing by clearing the class field

    configurations which rely on probing must be fixed up by adding a
    proper I2C device node to the DTS file, like the TQM85xx modules.

    powerpc/mpc5200: fix build warnings on mpc52xx_psc_spi driver
    
    The register definitions have been changed for the mpc5200 PSC ports
    to cover some of the changes in the mpc5200b.  One change is that the
    ccr register is now a u32 instead of a u16.  However, for the purposes
    of this driver we want to continue to use 16 bit access to avoid
    changing the existing (working) behaviour.
    
    This patch allows the driver to continue to do 16 bit accesses without
    the compiler complaining about it.

    sched: sync wakeups vs avg_overlap
    
    While looking at the code I wondered why we always do:
    
      sync && avg_overlap < migration_cost
    
    Which is a bit odd, since the overlap test was meant to detect sync wakeups
    so using it to specialize sync wakeups doesn't make much sense.
    
    Hence change the code to do:
    
      sync || avg_overlap < migration_cost

    netfilter: xtables: move extension arguments into compound structure (1/6)
    
    The function signatures for Xtables extensions have grown over time.
    It involves a lot of typing/replication, and also a bit of stack space
    even if they are not used. Realize an NFWS2008 idea and pack them into
    structs. The skb remains outside of the struct so gcc can continue to
    apply its optimizations.
    
    This patch does this for match extensions' match functions.
    
    A few ambiguities have also been addressed. The "offset" parameter for
    example has been renamed to "fragoff" (there are so many different
    offsets already) and "protoff" to "thoff" (there is more than just one
    protocol here, so clarify).

    Conntrack code will use it for
    a) removing expectations and helpers when corresponding module is removed, and
    b) removing conntracks when L3 protocol conntrack module is removed.

    netfilter: netns nf_conntrack: add ->ct_net -- pointer from conntrack to netns
    
    Conntrack (struct nf_conn) gets pointer to netns: ->ct_net -- netns in which
    it was created. It comes from netdevice.
    
    ->ct_net is write-once field.
    
    Every conntrack in system has ->ct_net initialized, no exceptions.
    
    ->ct_net doesn't pin netns: conntracks are recycled after timeouts and
    pinning background traffic will prevent netns from even starting shutdown
    sequence.
    
    Right now every conntrack is created in init_net.

    netfilter: implement NFPROTO_UNSPEC as a wildcard for extensions
    
    When a match or target is looked up using xt_find_{match,target},
    Xtables will also search the NFPROTO_UNSPEC module list. This allows
    for protocol-independent extensions (like xt_time) to be reused from
    other components (e.g. arptables, ebtables).
    
    Extensions that take different codepaths depending on match->family
    or target->family of course cannot use NFPROTO_UNSPEC within the
    registration structure (e.g. xt_pkttype).

    Don't use __init but __devinit to define probe function.  A pointer to

    so the function must not disappear when the init code is freed.  Using

    sparc32: sun4m interrupt mask cleanup
    
    Here is an updated version of a patch I wrote 6 years ago
    http://marc.info/?l=linux-sparc&m=103939103607617&w=2
    that simplifies interrupt mask lookup.  It's main purpose
    is to add VME bus support but it's really a cleanup of the mask code.

    sunrpc: fix oops in rpc_create when the mount namespace is unshared
    
    On a system with nfs mounts, if a task unshares its mount namespace,
    a oops can occur when the system is rebooted if the task is the last
    to unreference the nfs mount. It will try to create a rpc request
    using utsname() which has been invalidated by free_nsproxy().
    
    The patch fixes the issue by using the global init_utsname() which is
    always valid. the capability of identifying rpc clients per uts namespace
    stills needs some extra work so this should not be a problem.

    NFS: Client mounts hang when exported directory do not exist
    
    This patch fixes a regression that was introduced by the string based mounts.
    
    nfs_mount() statically returns -EACCES for every error returned
    by the remote mounted. This is incorrect because -EACCES is
    an non-fatal error to the mount.nfs command. This error causes
    mount.nfs to retry the mount even in the case when the exported
    directory does not exist.
    
    This patch maps the errors returned by the remote mountd into
    valid errno values, exactly how it was done pre-string based
    mounts. By returning the correct errno enables mount.nfs
    to do the right thing.

    SUNRPC: Fix autobind on cloned rpc clients
    
    Despite the fact that cloned rpc clients won't have the cl_autobind flag
    set, they may still find themselves calling rpcb_getport_async(). For this
    to happen, it suffices for a _parent_ rpc_clnt to use autobinding, in which
    case any clone may find itself triggering the !xprt_bound() case in
    call_bind().
    
    The correct fix for this is to walk back up the tree of cloned rpc clients,
    in order to find the parent that 'owns' the transport, either because it
    has clnt->cl_autobind set, or because it originally created the
    transport...

    NFS: SETCLIENTID truncates client ID and netid
    
    The sc_name field is currently 56 bytes long.  This is not large enough
    to hold a pair of IPv6 addresses, the authentication type, the protocol
    name, and a uniquifier number.  The maximum possible size of the name
    string using IPv6 addresses is just under 110 bytes, so I increased the
    size of the sc_name field to accomodate this maximum.
    
    In addition, the strings in the nfs4_setclientid structure are
    constructed with scnprintf(), which wants to terminate its output with
    '\0'.  The sc_netid field was large enough only for a three byte netid
    string and a '\0' so inet6 netids were being truncated.  Perhaps we
    don't need the overhead of scnprintf() to do a simple string copy, but
    I fixed this by increasing the size of the buffer by one byte.
    
    Since all three of the string buffers in nfs4_setclientid are
    constructed with scnprintf(), I increased the size of all three by one
    byte to document the requirement, although I don't think either the
    universal address field or the name field will be so small that these
    strings get truncated in this way.
    
    The size of the Linux client's client ID on the wire will be larger
    than before.  RFC 3530 suggests the size limit for client IDs is 1024,
    and we are still well below that.

    nfs: authenticated deep mounting
    
    Allow mount to do authenticated mounts below the root of the exported tree.
    The wording in RFC 2623, sec 2.3.2. allows fsinfo with UNIX authentication
    on the root of the export. Mounts are not always done on the root
    of the exported tree. Especially autoumounts often mount below the root of
    the exported tree.
    Some server implementations (justly) require full authentication for the
    so-called deep mounts. The old code used AUTH_SYS only. This caused deep
    mounts to fail on systems requiring stronger authentication..
    The client should try both authentication types and use the first one that
    succeeds.
    This method was already partially implemented. This patch completes
    the implementation for NFS2 and NFS3.
    This patch was developed to allow Debian systems to automount home directories
    on Solaris servers with krb5 authentication.

    justification for this now that we have improved our ability to detect
    stale attribute data, so we should remove that serialisation.

    In the case where there are parallel RPC calls to the same inode, we may

    Currently, __nfs_revalidate_inode() is calling nfs_update_inode() directly,

    up with stale metadata.

    x86: xsave: set FP, SSE bits in the xsave header in the user sigcontext
    
    If a processor implementation discern that a processor state component is in
    its initialized state, it may modify the corresponding bit in the
    xsave header.xstate_bv as '0'. State in the memory layout setup by 'xsave'
    will be consistent with the bit values in the header.
    
    During signal handling, legacy applications may change the FP/SSE bits
    in the sigcontext memory layout without touching the FP/SSE header bits
    in the xsave header. So always set FP/SSE bits in the xsave header
    while saving the sigcontext state to the user space. During signal return,
    this will enable the kernel to capture any changes to the FP/SSE bits by the
    legacy applications which don't touch xsave headers.
    
    xsave aware apps can change the xstate_bv in the xsave header aswell
    as change any contents in the memory layout. xrestor as part of sigreturn
    will capture all the changes.

    NFS: Fix the NFS attribute update
    
    Currently nfs_refresh_inode() will only update the inode metadata if it
    sees that the RPC call that returned the nfs_fattr was started
    after the last update of the inode. This means that if we have parallel
    RPC calls to the same inode (when sending WRITE calls, for instance), we
    may often miss updates.
    
    This patch attempts to recover those missed updates by also accepting
    them if the ctime in the nfs_fattr is more recent than the inode's
    cached ctime.
    It also recovers the case where the file size has increased, but the
    ctime has not been updated due to limited ctime resolution.

    [CIFS] make sure we have the right resume info before calling CIFSFindNext
    
    When we do a seekdir() or equivalent, we usually end up doing a
    FindFirst call and then call FindNext until we get to the offset that we
    want. The problem is that when we call FindNext, the code usually
    doesn't have the proper info (mostly, the filename of the entry from the
    last search) to resume the search.
    
    Add a "last_entry" field to the cifs_search_info that points to the last
    entry in the search. We calculate this pointer by using the
    LastNameOffset field from the search parms that are returned. We then
    use that info to do a cifs_save_resume_key before we call CIFSFindNext.
    
    This patch allows CIFS to reliably pass the "telldir" connectathon test.

    On some HP nx6... laptops (e.g. nx6325) BIOS reports an IRQ0 override
    but the SB450 chipset is configured such that timer interrupts goe to
    INT0 of IOAPIC.
    
    Check IRQ0 routing and if it is routed to INT0 of IOAPIC skip the
    timer override.

    powerpc: Fix sysfs pci mmap on 32-bit machines with 64-bit PCI
    
    When manipulating 64-bit PCI addresses, the code would lose the
    top 32-bit in a couple of places when shifting a pfn due to missing
    type casting from the 32-bit pfn to a 64-bit resource before the
    shift.
    
    This breaks using newer X servers for example on 440 machines
    with the PCI bus above 32-bit.

    powerpc: Honor O_NONBLOCK flag when reading RTAS log
    
    rtas_log_read() doesn't check file flags for O_NONBLOCK and blocks
    non-blocking readers of /proc/ppc64/rtas/error_log when there is
    no data available. This fixes it.
    
    Also rtas_log_read() returns now with ENODATA to prevent suspending of
    process in wait_event_interruptible() when logging facility was
    switched off and log is already empty.

    powerpc: Enforce sane MAX_ORDER
    
    powerpc uses CONFIG_FORCE_MAX_ZONEORDER, and some things depend on it
    being at least 10 when 64k pages are not configured (notably the dart
    iommu code with CONFIG_PM). The defaults are fine, but when going from a
    64K pages config to one without 64K pages, MAX_ORDER stays at 9 which is
    too low for 4K pages.
    
    This patch makes the Kconfig enforce at least the defaults.

    powerpc: Avoid integer overflow in page_is_ram()
    
    Commit 8b150478 ("ppc: make phys_mem_access_prot() work with pfns
    instead of addresses") fixed page_is_ram() in arch/ppc to avoid overflow
    for addresses above 4G on 32-bit kernels.  However arch/powerpc's
    page_is_ram() is missing the same fix -- it computes a physical address
    by doing pfn << PAGE_SHIFT, which overflows if pfn corresponds to a page
    above 4G.
    
    In particular this causes pages above 4G to be mapped with the wrong
    caching attribute; for example many ppc440-based SoCs have PCI space
    above 4G, and mmap()ing MMIO space may end up with a mapping that has
    caching enabled.
    
    Fix this by working with the pfn and avoiding the conversion to
    physical address that causes the overflow.  This patch compares the
    pfn to max_pfn, which is a semantic change from the old code -- that
    code compared the physical address to high_memory, which corresponds
    to max_low_pfn.  However, I think that was is another bug, since
    highmem pages are still RAM.

    BKL protection in nfs_file_llseek() is no longer sufficient to ensure that
    inode->i_size is read safely in generic_file_llseek_unlocked().
    
    In order to fix the situation, we either have to replace the naked read of
    inode->i_size in generic_file_llseek_unlocked() with i_size_read(), or the
    whole thing needs to be executed under the inode->i_lock;
    In order to avoid disrupting other filesystems, avoid touching

    mac80211: avoid "Wireless Event too big" message for assoc response
    
    The association response IEs are sent to userland with an IWEVCUSTOM
    event, which unfortunately is limited to a little more than 100 bytes
    of IE information with the encoding used.  Many APs send so much
    IE information that this message overflows.  When the IWEVCUSTOM
    event is too large, the kernel doesn't send it to userland anyway --
    better just not to send it.
    
    An attempt was made by Jouni Malinen to correct this issue by
    converting to use IWEVASSOCREQIE and IWEVASSOCRESPIE messages instead
    ("mac80211: Use IWEVASSOCREQIE instead of IWEVCUSTOM").  Unfortunately,
    that caused a problem due to 32-/64-bit interactions on some systems and
    was reverted after the 'userland ABI' rule was invoked.  That leaves
    us with this option instead of a proper fix, at least until we move
    to a cfg80211-based solution.

    Use FRMR to map local RPC reply data. This allows RDMA_WRITE to send reply

    svcrdma: Modify the RPC recv path to use FRMR when available
    
    RPCRDMA requests that specify a read-list are fetched with RDMA_READ. Using
    an FRMR to map the data sink improves NFSRDMA security on transports that
    place the RDMA_READ data sink LKEY on the wire because the valid lifetime
    of the MR is only the duration of the RDMA_READ. The LKEY is invalidated
    when the last RDMA_READ WR completes.
    
    Mapping the data sink also allows for very large amounts to data to be
    fetched with a single WR, so if the client is also using FRMR, the entire
    RPC read-list can be fetched with a single WR.

    atmel-mci: Add experimental DMA support
    
    This adds support for DMA transfers through the generic DMA engine
    framework with the DMA slave extensions.
    
    The driver has been tested using mmc-block and ext3fs on several SD,
    SDHC and MMC+ cards. Reads and writes work fine, with read transfer
    rates up to 7.5 MiB/s on fast cards with debugging disabled.
    
    Unfortunately, the driver has been known to lock up from time to time
    with DMA enabled, so DMA support is currently optional and marked
    EXPERIMENTAL. However, I didn't see any problems while testing 13
    different cards (MMC, SD and SDHC of different brands and sizes), so I
    suspect the "Initialize BLKR before sending data transfer command" fix
    that was posted earlier fixed this as well.

    multiplexing access to the controller so that multiple card slots can be
    used as if they were hooked up to separate mmc controllers.
    
    The atmel-mci driver registers each slot as a separate mmc_host. Both
    access the same common controller state, but they also have some state
    on their own for card detection/write protect handling, and separate
    shadows of the MR and SDCR registers.
    
    When one of the slots receives a request from the mmc core, the common
    controller state is checked. If it's idle, the request is submitted
    immediately. If not, the request is added to a queue. When a request is
    done, the queue is checked and if there is a queued request, it is
    submitted before the completion callback is called.
    
    This patch also includes a few cleanups and fixes, including a locking
    overhaul. I had to change the locking extensively in any case, so I
    might as well try to get it right. The driver no longer takes any
    irq-safe locks, which may or may not improve the overall system
    performance.
    
    This patch also adds a bit of documentation of the internal data
    structures.

    atmel-mci: Platform code for supporting multiple mmc slots
    
    Add the necessary platform infrastructure to support multiple mmc/sdcard
    slots all at once through a single controller. Currently, the driver
    will use the first valid slot it finds and stick with that, but later
    patches will add support for switching between several slots on the fly.
    
    Extend the platform data structure with per-slot information: MMC/SDcard
    bus width and card detect/write protect pins. This will affect the pin
    muxing as well as the capabilities announced to the mmc core.
    
    Note that board code is now required to supply a mci_platform_data
    struct to at32_add_device_mci().

    atmel-mci: Don't stop the clock between transfers
    
    Some cards might get upset if we turn off the clock for extended periods
    of time. So keep the clock running until the mmc core tells us to turn
    it off.
    
    Also, don't reset the controller between each transfer. That was an
    attempt to work around earlier bugs, and it never really worked very
    well.

    atmel-mci: Implement tasklet as a state machine
    
    With the current system of completed/pending events, things may get
    handled in different order depending on which event triggers first. For
    example, if the data transfer is complete before the command, the stop
    command must be sent after the command is complete, not the data. This
    creates a bit of complexity around the stop command.
    
    By having the tasklet go through a sequence of clearly defined states,
    things always happen in a certain order even if the events come at
    different times, so the stop command can simply be sent when we exit the
    "sending data" state because we will never enter that state before the
    command has been sent successfully.

    atmel-mci: Initialize BLKR before sending data transfer command
    
    The atmel-mci driver sometimes fails data transfers like this:
    
       mmcblk0: error -5 transferring data
       end_request: I/O error, dev mmcblk0, sector 2749769
       end_request: I/O error, dev mmcblk0, sector 2749777
    
    It turns out that this might be caused by the BLKR register (which
    contains the block size and the number of blocks being transfered) being
    initialized too late. This patch moves the initialization of BLKR so
    that it contains the correct value before the block transfer command is
    sent.
    
    This error is difficult to reproduce, but if you insert a long delay
    (mdelay(10) or thereabouts) between the calls to atmci_start_command()
    and atmci_submit_data(), all transfers seem to fail without this patch,
    while I haven't seen any failures with this patch.

    NLM: Always start both UDP and TCP listeners
    
    Commit 24e36663, which first appeared in 2.6.19, changed lockd so that
    the client side starts a UDP listener only if there is a UDP NFSv2/v3
    mount.  Its description notes:
    
        This... means that lockd will *not* listen on UDP if the only
        mounts are TCP mount (and nfsd hasn't started).
    
        The latter is the only one that concerns me at all - I don't know
        if this might be a problem with some servers.
    
    Unfortunately it is a problem for Linux itself.  The rpc.statd daemon
    on Linux uses UDP for contacting the local lockd, no matter which
    protocol is used for NFS mounts.  Without a local lockd UDP listener,
    NFSv2/v3 lock recovery from Linux NFS clients always fails.
    
    Revert parts of commit 24e36663 so lockd_up() always starts both
    listeners.

    sched_rt.c: resch needed in rt_rq_enqueue() for the root rt_rq
    
    While working on the new version of the code for SCHED_SPORADIC I
    noticed something strange in the present throttling mechanism. More
    specifically in the throttling timer handler in sched_rt.c
    (do_sched_rt_period_timer()) and in rt_rq_enqueue().
    
    The problem is that, when unthrottling a runqueue, rt_rq_enqueue() only
    asks for rescheduling if the runqueue has a sched_entity associated to
    it (i.e., rt_rq->rt_se != NULL).
    Now, if the runqueue is the root rq (which has a rt_se = NULL)
    rescheduling does not take place, and it is delayed to some undefined
    instant in the future.
    
    This imply some random bandwidth usage by the RT tasks under throttling.
    For instance, setting rt_runtime_us/rt_period_us = 950ms/1000ms an RT
    task will get less than 95%. In our tests we got something varying
    between 70% to 95%.
    Using smaller time values, e.g., 95ms/100ms, things are even worse, and
    I can see values also going down to 20-25%!!
    
    The tests we performed are simply running 'yes' as a SCHED_FIFO task,
    and checking the CPU usage with top, but we can investigate thoroughly
    if you think it is needed.
    
    Things go much better, for us, with the attached patch... Don't know if
    it is the best approach, but it solved the issue for us.

    selinux: Fix an uninitialized variable BUG/panic in selinux_secattr_to_sid()
    
    At some point during the 2.6.27 development cycle two new fields were added
    to the SELinux context structure, a string pointer and a length field.  The
    code in selinux_secattr_to_sid() was not modified and as a result these two
    fields were left uninitialized which could result in erratic behavior,
    including kernel panics, when NetLabel is used.  This patch fixes the

    use and reducing the level of direct context manipulation done to help
    prevent future problems.

    generic block based fiemap implementation
    
    Any block based fs (this patch includes ext3) just has to declare its own
    fiemap() function and then call this generic function with its own
    get_block_t. This works well for block based filesystems that will map
    multiple contiguous blocks at one time, but will work for filesystems that
    only map one block at a time, you will just end up with an "extent" for each
    block. One gotcha is this will not play nicely where there is hole+data
    after the EOF. This function will assume its hit the end of the data as soon
    as it hits a hole after the EOF, so if there is any data past that it will
    not pick that up. AFAIK no block based fs does this anyway, but its in the
    comments of the function anyway just in case.

    Plug ocfs2 into ->fiemap. Some portions of ocfs2_get_clusters() had to be

    which extent is the last one in the btree. Also, I'm not sure we want to be

    vfs: vfs-level fiemap interface
    
    Basic vfs-level fiemap infrastructure, which sets up a new ->fiemap
    inode operation.
    
    Userspace can get extent information on a file via fiemap ioctl. As input,
    the fiemap ioctl takes a struct fiemap which includes an array of struct
    fiemap_extent (fm_extents). Size of the extent array is passed as
    fm_extent_count and number of extents returned will be written into
    fm_mapped_extents. Offset and length fields on the fiemap structure
    (fm_start, fm_length) describe a logical range which will be searched for
    extents. All extents returned will at least partially contain this range.
    The actual extent offsets and ranges returned will be unmodified from their
    offset and range on-disk.
    
    The fiemap ioctl returns '0' on success. On error, -1 is returned and errno
    is set. If errno is equal to EBADR, then fm_flags will contain those flags
    which were passed in which the kernel did not understand. On all other
    errors, the contents of fm_extents is undefined.
    
    As fiemap evolved, there have been many authors of the vfs patch. As far as
    I can tell, the list includes:

    ext4: fix xattr deadlock
    
    ext4_xattr_set_handle() eventually ends up calling
    ext4_mark_inode_dirty() which tries to expand the inode by shifting
    the EAs.  This leads to the xattr_sem being downed again and leading
    to a deadlock.
    
    This patch makes sure that if ext4_xattr_set_handle() is in the
    call-chain, ext4_mark_inode_dirty() will not expand the inode.

    jbd2: abort instead of waiting for nonexistent transaction
    
    The __jbd2_log_wait_for_space function sits in a loop checkpointing
    transactions until there is sufficient space free in the journal.
    However, if there are no transactions to be processed (e.g.  because the
    free space calculation is wrong due to a corrupted filesystem) it will
    never progress.
    
    Check for space being required when no transactions are outstanding and
    abort the journal instead of endlessly looping.

    ext4: fix initialization of UNINIT bitmap blocks
    
    This fixes a bug which caused on-line resizing of filesystems with a
    1k blocksize to fail.  The root cause of this bug was the fact that if
    an uninitalized bitmap block gets read in by userspace (which
    e2fsprogs does try to avoid, but can happen when the blocksize is less
    than the pagesize and an adjacent blocks is read into memory)
    ext4_read_block_bitmap() was erroneously depending on the buffer
    uptodate flag to decide whether it needed to initialize the bitmap
    block in memory --- i.e., to set the standard set of blocks in use by
    a block group (superblock, bitmaps, inode table, etc.).  Essentially,
    ext4_read_block_bitmap() assumed it was the only routine that might
    try to read a block containing a block bitmap, which is simply not
    true.
    
    To fix this, ext4_read_block_bitmap() and ext4_read_inode_bitmap()
    must always initialize uninitialized bitmap blocks.  Once a block or
    inode is allocated out of that bitmap, it will be marked as
    initialized in the block group descriptor, so in general this won't
    result any extra unnecessary work.

    ext4: Use readahead when reading an inode from the inode table
    
    With modern hard drives, reading 64k takes roughly the same time as
    reading a 4k block.  So request readahead for adjacent inode table
    blocks to reduce the time it takes when iterating over directories
    (especially when doing this in htree sort order) in a cold cache case.
    With this patch, the time it takes to run "git status" on a kernel
    tree after flushing the caches via "echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"
    is reduced by 21%.

    lockd: reject reclaims outside the grace period
    
    The current lockd does not reject reclaims that arrive outside of the
    grace period.
    
    Accepting a reclaim means promising to the client that no conflicting
    locks were granted since last it held the lock.  We can meet that
    promise if we assume the only lockers are nfs clients, and that they are
    sufficiently well-behaved to reclaim only locks that they held before,
    and that only reclaim locks have been permitted so far.  Once we leave
    the grace period (and start permitting non-reclaims), we can no longer
    keep that promise.  So we must start rejecting reclaims at that point.

    nfsd: common grace period control
    
    Rewrite grace period code to unify management of grace period across
    lockd and nfsd.  The current code has lockd and nfsd cooperate to
    compute a grace period which is satisfactory to them both, and then
    individually enforce it.  This creates a slight race condition, since
    the enforcement is not coordinated.  It's also more complicated than
    necessary.
    
    Here instead we have lockd and nfsd each inform common code when they
    enter the grace period, and when they're ready to leave the grace
    period, and allow normal locking only after both of them are ready to
    leave.
    
    We also expect the locks_start_grace()/locks_end_grace() interface here
    to be simpler to build on for future cluster/high-availability work,
    which may require (for example) putting individual filesystems into
    grace, or enforcing grace periods across multiple cluster nodes.

    [SCSI] zfcp: fix deadlock caused by shared work queue tasks
    
    Each adapter reopen trigger automatically a scan_port task which
    is waiting for the ERP to be finished before further processing.
    Since the initial device setup enqueues adapter, port and LUN which
    are individual ERP actions, this process would start after
    everything is done. Unfortunately the port_reopen requires another
    scheduled work to be finished which is queued after the automatic
    scan_port -> deadlock !
    
    This fix creates an own work queue for ERP based nameserver requests.

    [SCSI] zfcp: attach and release SAN nameserver port on demand
    
    Changing the zfcp behaviour from always having the nameserver port
    open to an on-demand strategy.  This strategy reduces the use of
    limited resources like port connections. The patch provides a common
    infrastructure which could be used for all WKA ports in future.
    
    Also reduce the number of nameserver lookups by changing the zfcp
    behaviour of always querying the nameserver for the corresponding
    destination ID of the remote port.  If the destination ID has changed
    during the reopen process we will be informed and then trigger a
    nameserver query on demand.

     - Remove unused references and declarations, including one instance
       of the FC ls_adisc struct that has been defined twice.
     - Also remove the flags COMMON_OPENING, COMMON_CLOSING,
       ADAPTER_REGISTERED and XPORT_OK that are only set and cleared, but
       not checked anywhere.
     - Remove the zfcp specific atomic_test_mask makro. Simply use
       atomic_read directly instead.
     - Remove the zfcp internal sg helper functions and switch the places
       where it is still used to call sg_virt directly.
     - With the update of the QDIO code, the QDIO data structures no
       longer use the volatile type qualifier. Now we can also remove the
       volatile qualifiers from the zfcp code.

         I recommend we pass the channel number in fc_vport_create rather

         Also, ids->vport_type should be set to FC_PORTTYPE_NPIV prior to
         calling fc_vport_create. The comment is also meaningless.

    [SCSI] Update the SCSI state model to allow blocking in the created state
    
    Brian King <brking@linux.vnet.ibm.com> reported that fibre channel
    devices can oops during scanning if their ports block (because the
    device goes from CREATED -> BLOCK -> RUNNING rather than CREATED ->
    BLOCK -> CREATED).
    
    Fix this by adding a new state: CREATED_BLOCK which can only transition
    back to CREATED and disallow the CREATED -> BLOCK transition.  Now both
    the created and blocked states that the mid-layer recognises can include
    CREATED_BLOCK.

    [SCSI] scsi_netlink: Add transport and LLD recieve and event support
    
    This patch adds scsi netlink recieve and event support for transport
    and scsi LLDD's.  It is a reimplementation of the patch posted last
    week by David Somayajulu.
    http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=121745486221819&w=2
    
    There are a few things done differently:
    
    - Transport support is included
    
    - Event delivery is included
    
    - The vendor message is now its own unique message type, considered
      part of the generic "SCSI Transport".
    
    - LLDD entry points are now registered rather than included in the
      scsi_host_template.
    
      Background: When I started to implement the event handler via template,
      I had to either: muck up scsi_add_host and scsi_remove_host;  or have
      the event handler search all possible shosts. Neither was acceptable.
      Moving to a registration solves this, and also limits the scope of
      the changes to something that could be backported to a distro without
      breaking an already-released-distro kabi. However, I admit it isn't
      as elegant, as the passing of the LLDD host template in the
      registration and the complexity around dynamic add/remove shows.
    
    - The receive path was augmented to require a unique identifier for
      the LLDD before the message was allowed to be handed off to the
      driver. Given how quickly very fatal errors occur if there's msg
      mismatches (which I saw in testing my own tools :), I believe this
      to be a very good thing. The id plays off the vendor id scheme already
      introduced for the vendor unique event messages used by FC.
      Additionally, the id use as the basis of the registration/deregistration.
    
    - Send assist functions, for both the transport and LLDDs are included.

    [SCSI] scsi_host_lookup: error returns and NULL pointers
    
    This patch cleans up the behavior of scsi_host_lookup().
    
    The original implementation attempted to use the dual role of
    either returning a pointer value, or a negative error code.
    User's needed to use IS_ERR() to check the result. Additionally,
    the IS_ERR() macro never checks for when a NULL pointer was
    returned, so a NULL pointer actually passes with a success case.
    Note: scsi_host_get(), used by scsi_host_lookup(), can return
    a NULL pointer.
    
    Talk about a mudhole for the unitiated to step into....
    
    This patch converts scsi_host_lookup() to return either NULL
    or a valid pointer. The consumers were updated for the change.

    [ARM] 5278/1: i2c-pxa fast mode support
    
    Add fast_mode option to i2c_pxa_platform_data and use it to set the
    ICR_FM bit appropriately when i2c_pxa_reset is called. Parameter
    called fast_mode rather than frequency as this driver is also used
    for the i2c_pxa_pwr bus which has different normal and fast frequencies.

    [ARM] 5276/1: ep93xx: allow selecting UART for early kernel messages
    
    Currently on the EP93xx platform early kernel messages go to UART1.
    Since this UART is the only one that has modem control signals it
    might be used for another purpose and it is undesirable for those
    messages to appear. This patch allows one of the other UARTs to be
    selected in the kernel configuration. It is assumed that the
    bootloader has configured and initialized the UART since this was the
    previous assumption.

    rcu: RCU-based detection of stalled CPUs for Classic RCU
    
    This patch adds stalled-CPU detection to Classic RCU.  This capability
    is enabled by a new config variable CONFIG_RCU_CPU_STALL_DETECTOR, which
    defaults disabled.
    
    This is a debugging feature to detect infinite loops in kernel code, not
    something that non-kernel-hackers would be expected to care about.
    
    This feature can detect looping CPUs in !PREEMPT builds and looping CPUs
    with preemption disabled in PREEMPT builds.  This is essentially a port of
    this functionality from the treercu patch, replacing the stall debug patch
    that is already in tip/core/rcu (commit 67182ae1c4).
    
    The changes from the patch in tip/core/rcu include making the config
    variable name match that in treercu, changing from seconds to jiffies to
    avoid spurious warnings, and printing a boot message when this feature
    is enabled.

    sctp: Fix to start T5-shutdown-guard timer while enter SHUTDOWN-SENT state
    
    RFC 4960: Section 9.2
    The sender of the SHUTDOWN MAY also start an overall guard timer
    'T5-shutdown-guard' to bound the overall time for the shutdown
    sequence.  At the expiration of this timer, the sender SHOULD abort
    the association by sending an ABORT chunk.  If the 'T5-shutdown-
    guard' timer is used, it SHOULD be set to the recommended value of 5
    times 'RTO.Max'.
    
    The timer 'T5-shutdown-guard' is used to counter the overall time
    for shutdown sequence, and it's start by the sender of the SHUTDOWN.
    So timer 'T5-shutdown-guard' should be start when we send the first
    SHUTDOWN chunk and enter the SHUTDOWN-SENT state, not start when we
    receipt of the SHUTDOWN primitive and enter SHUTDOWN-PENDING state.
    
    If 'T5-shutdown-guard' timer is start at SHUTDOWN-PENDING state, the
    association may be ABORT while data is still transmitting.

    tcp: Port redirection support for TCP
    
    Current TCP code relies on the local port of the listening socket
    being the same as the destination address of the incoming
    connection. Port redirection used by many transparent proxying
    techniques obviously breaks this, so we have to store the original
    destination port address.
    
    This patch extends struct inet_request_sock and stores the incoming
    destination port value there. It also modifies the handshake code to
    use that value as the source port when sending reply packets.

    transparent socket option set. This way we selectively enable certain
    connections with non-local source addresses to be routed.

    ipv4: Make inet_sock.h independent of route.h
    
    inet_iif() in inet_sock.h requires route.h. Since users of inet_iif()
    usually require other route.h functionality anyway this patch moves
    inet_iif() to route.h.

    ipv4: Allow binding to non-local addresses if IP_TRANSPARENT is set
    
    Setting IP_TRANSPARENT is not really useful without allowing non-local
    binds for the socket. To make user-space code simpler we allow these
    binds even if IP_TRANSPARENT is set but IP_FREEBIND is not.

    ipv4: Implement IP_TRANSPARENT socket option
    
    This patch introduces the IP_TRANSPARENT socket option: enabling that
    will make the IPv4 routing omit the non-local source address check on
    output. Setting IP_TRANSPARENT requires NET_ADMIN capability.

    ipv4: Loosen source address check on IPv4 output
    
    ip_route_output() contains a check to make sure that no flows with
    non-local source IP addresses are routed. This obviously makes using
    such addresses impossible.
    
    This patch introduces a flowi flag which makes omitting this check
    possible. The new flag provides a way of handling transparent and
    non-transparent connections differently.

    ipsec: Put dumpers on the dump list
    
    Herbert Xu came up with the idea and the original patch to make
    xfrm_state dump list contain also dumpers:
    
    As it is we go to extraordinary lengths to ensure that states
    don't go away while dumpers go to sleep.  It's much easier if
    we just put the dumpers themselves on the list since they can't
    go away while they're going.
    
    I've also changed the order of addition on new states to prevent
    a never-ending dump.
    
    Timo Teräs improved the patch to apply cleanly to latest tree,
    modified iteration code to be more readable by using a common
    struct for entries in the list, implemented the same idea for
    xfrm_policy dumping and moved the af_key specific "last" entry
    caching to af_key.

    powerpc/math-emu: Use kernel generic math-emu code
    
    The math emulation code is centered around a set of generic macros that
    provide the core of the emulation that are shared by the various
    architectures and other projects (like glibc).  Each arch implements its
    own sfp-machine.h to specific various arch specific details.
    
    For historic reasons that are now lost the powerpc math-emu code had
    its own version of the common headers.  This moves us to using the
    kernel generic version and thus getting fixes when those are updated.
    
    Also cleaned up exception/error reporting from the FP emulation functions.

    net: add skb_recycle_check() to enable netdriver skb recycling
    
    This patch adds skb_recycle_check(), which can be used by a network
    driver after transmitting an skb to check whether this skb can be
    recycled as a receive buffer.
    
    skb_recycle_check() checks that the skb is not shared or cloned, and
    that it is linear and its head portion large enough (as determined by
    the driver) to be recycled as a receive buffer.  If these conditions
    are met, it does any necessary reference count dropping and cleans
    up the skbuff as if it just came from __alloc_skb().

    x86: change MTRR_SANITIZER to def_bool y
    
    This option has been added in v2.6.26 as a default-disabled
    feature and went through several revisions since then.
    
    The feature fixes a wide range of MTRR setup problems that BIOSes
    leave us with: slow system, slow Xorg, slow system when adding lots
    of RAM, etc., so we want to enable it by default for v2.6.28.

    Fix by disabling rt2x00 rfkill support when rt2x00 is built-in and rfkill has been modularized, and
    a similar scheme for the relationship between leds_class and rt2x00..
    Also, give a warning to the end-user when rfkill-/leds-support is disabled this way, so that the
    end-user has at least some clues on what is going on.
    
    Proper fixing required some general updates of the Kconfig-structure for the rt2x00 driver, whereby
    internal configuration symbols had to be moved to after the user-visible configuration symbols.

    All of the above have been fixed. One question, however, remains: In struct
    bootrec, the array "data" is treated in many places as native CPU order, but
    it may be little-endian everywhere. As far as I can tell, this driver has only
    been used with little-endian hardware.

    IPoIB: Use netif_tx_lock() and get rid of private tx_lock, LLTX
    
    Currently, IPoIB is an LLTX driver that uses its own IRQ-disabling
    tx_lock.  Not only do we want to get rid of LLTX, this actually causes
    problems because of the skb_orphan() done with this tx_lock held: some
    skb destructors expect to be run with interrupts enabled.
    
    The simplest fix for this is to get rid of the driver-private tx_lock
    and stop using LLTX.  We kill off priv->tx_lock and use
    netif_tx_lock[_bh]() instead; the patch to do this is a tiny bit
    tricky because we need to update places that take priv->lock inside
    the tx_lock to disable IRQs, rather than relying on tx_lock having
    already disabled IRQs.
    
    Also, there are a couple of places where we need to disable BHs to
    make sure we have a consistent context to call netif_tx_lock() (since
    we no longer can use _irqsave() variants), and we also have to change
    ipoib_send_comp_handler() to call drain_tx_cq() through a timer rather
    than directly, because ipoib_send_comp_handler() runs in interrupt
    context and drain_tx_cq() must run in BH context so it can call
    netif_tx_lock().

    ibm_newemac: MAL support for PowerPC 405EZ
    
    The PowerPC 405EZ SoC has some differences in the interrupt layout and
    handling for the MAL.  The SERR, TXDE, and RXDE interrupts are OR'd into
    a single interrupt.  Also, due to the possibility for interrupt coalescing,
    the TXEOB and RXEOB interrupts require an interrupt bit to be cleared in
    the ICINTSTAT SDR.
    
    This sets the proper MAL feature bits for 405EZ boards, and adds a common
    shared handler for SERR, TXDE, and RXDE.  The defines for the ICINTSTAT DCR
    are added to the proper header file as well.
    
    This has been adapted from code originally written by Stefan Roese.

    ibm_newemac: Introduce mal_has_feature
    
    There are some PowerPC SoCs that do odd things with the MAL handling.  In
    order to accommodate them, we need to introduce a feature mechanism that is
    similar to the existing emac_has_feature function.
    
    This adds a feature variable to the mal_instance structure, and adds a
    mal_has_feature function.  Two features are defined and are guarded
    by Kconfig options that are selected by the affected platforms.
    
    MAL_FTR_CLEAR_ICINSTAT is used for platforms that need to clear the
    interrupt bits in the ICINTSTAT SDR for txeob/rxeob.  This is common
    on MAL implementations that have interrupt coalescing.
    
    MAL_FTR_COMMON_ERR_INT is used for platforms that have SERR, TXDE,
    and RXDE OR'd into a single interrupt bit.

    flow control.  We have the feature defined, but it currently can't be used
    because it is never added to EMAC_FTRS_POSSIBLE.
    
    This adds a Kconfig option for affected platforms to select and puts the
    feature in the EMAC_FTRS_POSSIBLE list.  This is set for PowerPC 405EZ
    platforms as well.

    IB/mthca: Use pci_request_regions()
    
    Back in prehistoric (pre-git!) days, the kernel's MSI-X support did
    request_mem_region() on a device's MSI-X tables, which meant that a
    driver that enabled MSI-X couldn't use pci_request_regions() (since
    that would clash with the PCI layer's MSI-X request).
    
    However, that was removed (by me!) years ago, so mthca can just use
    pci_request_regions() and pci_release_regions() instead of its own
    much more complicated code that avoids requesting the MSI-X tables.

    nfsd: use nfs client rpc callback program
    
    since commit ff7d9756b501744540be65e172d27ee321d86103
    "nfsd: use static memory for callback program and stats"
    do_probe_callback uses a static callback program
    (NFS4_CALLBACK) rather than the one set in clp->cl_callback.cb_prog
    as passed in by the client in setclientid (4.0)
    or create_session (4.1).
    
    This patches introduces rpc_create_args.prognumber that allows
    overriding program->number when creating rpc_clnt.

    nfsd: do_probe_callback should not clear rpc stats
    
    Now that cb_stats are static (since commit
    ff7d9756b501744540be65e172d27ee321d86103)
    there's no need to clear them.
    
    Initially I thought it might make sense to do
    that every callback probing but since the stats
    are per-program and they are shared between possibly
    several client callback instances, zeroing them out
    seems like the wrong thing to do.
    
    Note that that commit also introduced a bug
    since stats.program is also being cleared in the process
    and it is not restored after the memset as it used to be.

    SUNRPC: Clean up debug messages in rpcb_clnt.c
    
    The RPCB XDR functions are used for multiple procedures.  For instance,
    rpcb_encode_getaddr() is used for RPCB_GETADDR, RPCB_SET, and
    RPCB_UNSET.  Make the XDR debug messages more generic so they are less
    confusing.
    
    And, unlike in other RPC consumers in the kernel, a single debug flag
    enables all levels of debug messages in the RPC bind client, including
    XDR debug messages.  Since the XDR decoders already report success or
    failure in this case, remove redundant debug messages in the mid-level
    rpcb_register_call() function.

    SUNRPC: Register both netids for AF_INET6 servers
    
    TI-RPC is a user-space library of RPC functions that replaces ONC RPC
    and allows RPC to operate in the new world of IPv6.
    
    TI-RPC combines the concept of a transport protocol (UDP and TCP)
    and a protocol family (PF_INET and PF_INET6) into a single identifier
    called a "netid."  For example, "udp" means UDP over IPv4, and "udp6"
    means UDP over IPv6.
    
    For rpcbind, then, the RPC service tuple that is registered and
    advertised is:
    
      [RPC program, RPC version, service address and port, netid]
    
    instead of
    
      [RPC program, RPC version, port, protocol]
    
    Service address is typically ANYADDR, but can be a specific address
    of one of the interfaces on a multi-homed host.  The third item in
    the new tuple is expressed as a universal address.
    
    The current Linux rpcbind implementation registers a netid for both
    protocol families when RPCB_SET is done for just the PF_INET6 version
    of the netid (ie udp6 or tcp6).  So registering "udp6" causes a
    registration for "udp" to appear automatically as well.
    
    We've recently determined that this is incorrect behavior.  In the
    TI-RPC world, "udp6" is not meant to imply that the registered RPC
    service handles requests from AF_INET as well, even if the listener
    socket does address mapping.  "udp" and "udp6" are entirely separate
    capabilities, and must be registered separately.
    
    The Linux kernel, unlike TI-RPC, leverages address mapping to allow a
    single listener socket to handle requests for both AF_INET and AF_INET6.
    This is still OK, but the kernel currently assumes registering "udp6"
    will cover "udp" as well.  It registers only "udp6" for it's AF_INET6
    services, even though they handle both AF_INET and AF_INET6 on the same
    port.
    
    So svc_register() actually needs to register both "udp" and "udp6"
    explicitly (and likewise for TCP).  Until rpcbind is fixed, the
    kernel can ignore the return code for the second RPCB_SET call.

    SUNRPC: Support IPv6 when registering kernel RPC services
    
    In order to advertise NFS-related services on IPv6 interfaces via
    rpcbind, the kernel RPC server implementation must use
    rpcb_v4_register() instead of rpcb_register().
    
    A new kernel build option allows distributions to use the legacy
    v2 call until they integrate an appropriate user-space rpcbind
    daemon that can support IPv6 RPC services.
    
    I tried adding some automatic logic to fall back if registering
    with a v4 protocol request failed, but there are too many corner
    cases.  So I just made it a compile-time switch that distributions
    can throw when they've replaced portmapper with rpcbind.

    SUNRPC: Simplify rpcb_register() API
    
    Bruce suggested there's no need to expose the difference between an error
    sending the PMAP_SET request and an error reply from the portmapper to
    rpcb_register's callers.  The user space equivalent of rpcb_register() is
    pmap_set(3), which returns a bool_t : either the PMAP set worked, or it
    didn't.  Simple.
    
    So let's remove the "*okay" argument from rpcb_register() and
    rpcb_v4_register(), and simply return an error if any part of the call
    didn't work.

    SUNRPC: Set V6ONLY socket option for RPC listener sockets
    
    My plan is to use an AF_INET listener on systems that support only IPv4,
    and an AF_INET6 listener on systems that can support IPv6. Incoming
    IPv4 packets will be posted to an AF_INET6 listener with a mapped IPv4
    address.
    
    Max Matveev <makc@sgi.com> says:
      Creating a single listener can be dangerous - if net.ipv6.bindv6only
      is enabled then it's possible to create another listener in v4
      namespace on the same port and steal the traffic from the "unifed"
      listener. You need to disable V6ONLY explicitly via a sockopt to stop
      that.
    
    Set appropriate socket option on RPC server listener sockets to prevent
    this.

    lockd: don't depend on lockd main loop to end grace
    
    End lockd's grace period using schedule_delayed_work() instead of a
    check on every pass through the main loop.
    
    After a later patch, we'll depend on lockd to end its grace period even
    if it's not currently handling requests; so it shouldn't depend on being
    woken up from the main loop to do so.
    
    Also, Nakano Hiroaki (who independently produced a similar patch)
    noticed that the current behavior is buggy in the face of jiffies
    wraparound:
    
    	"lockd uses time_before() to determine whether the grace period
    	has expired. This would seem to be enough to avoid timer
    	wrap-around issues, but, unfortunately, that is not the case.
    	The time_* family of comparison functions can be safely used to
    	compare jiffies relatively close in time, but they stop working
    	after approximately LONG_MAX/2 ticks. nfsd can suffer this
    	problem because the time_before() comparison in lockd() is not
    	performed until the first request comes in, which means that if
    	there is no lockd traffic for more than LONG_MAX/2 ticks we are
    	screwed.
    
    	"The implication of this is that once time_before() starts
    	misbehaving any attempt from a NFS client to execute fcntl()
    	will be received with a NLM_LCK_DENIED_GRACE_PERIOD message for
    	25 days (assuming HZ=1000). In other words, the 50 seconds grace
    	period could turn into a grace period of 50 days or more.

    The check here is currently harmless but unnecessary, since, as the

    And eventually we want to allow multiple grace periods that come and go

    knfsd: allocate readahead cache in individual chunks
    
    I had a report from someone building a large NFS server that they were
    unable to start more than 585 nfsd threads. It was reported against an
    older kernel using the slab allocator, and I tracked it down to the
    large allocation in nfsd_racache_init failing.
    
    It appears that the slub allocator handles large allocations better,
    but large contiguous allocations can often be problematic. There
    doesn't seem to be any reason that the racache has to be allocated as a
    single large chunk. This patch breaks this up so that the racache is
    built up from separate allocations.

    nfsd: permit unauthenticated stat of export root
    
    RFC 2623 section 2.3.2 permits the server to bypass gss authentication
    checks for certain operations that a client may perform when mounting.
    In the case of a client that doesn't have some form of credentials
    available to it on boot, this allows it to perform the mount unattended.
    (Presumably real file access won't be needed until a user with
    credentials logs in.)
    
    Being slightly more lenient allows lots of old clients to access
    krb5-only exports, with the only loss being a small amount of
    information leaked about the root directory of the export.
    
    This affects only v2 and v3; v4 still requires authentication for all
    access.
    
    Thanks to Peter Staubach testing against a Solaris client, which
    suggesting addition of v3 getattr, to the list, and to Trond for noting
    that doing so exposes no additional information.

    [ARM] dma: fix dmabounce dma_sync_xxx() implementations
    
    The dmabounce dma_sync_xxx() implementation have been broken for
    quite some time; they all copy data between the DMA buffer and
    the CPU visible buffer no irrespective of the change of ownership.
    (IOW, a DMA_FROM_DEVICE mapping copies data from the DMA buffer
    to the CPU buffer during a call to dma_sync_single_for_device().)
    
    Fix it by getting rid of sync_single(), moving the contents into
    the recently created dmabounce_sync_for_xxx() functions and adjusting
    appropriately.
    
    This also makes it possible to properly support the DMA range sync
    functions.

    libata-eh: clear UNIT ATTENTION after reset
    
    Resets make ATAPI devices raise UNIT ATTENTION which fails the next
    command.  As resets can happen asynchronously for unrelated reasons,
    this sometimes disrupts innocent users.  For example, reading DVD
    fails after the system wakes up from suspend or the other device
    sharing the channel went through bus error.
    
    Clearing UA has some problems as it might clear UA which the userland
    needs to know about.  However, UA after resets can only be about the
    reset itself and benefits of clearing it overweights cons.  Missing UA
    can only delay failure to one of the following commands anyway.  For
    example, timeout while burning is in progress will trigger reset and
    reset the device state and probably corrupt the burning run.  Although
    the userland application won't get the UA, its pending writes will
    fail.

    libata: Implement disk shock protection support
    
    On user request (through sysfs), the IDLE IMMEDIATE command with UNLOAD
    FEATURE as specified in ATA-7 is issued to the device and processing of
    the request queue is stopped thereafter until the specified timeout
    expires or user space asks to resume normal operation. This is supposed
    to prevent the heads of a hard drive from accidentally crashing onto the
    platter when a heavy shock is anticipated (like a falling laptop
    expected to hit the floor). In fact, the whole port stops processing
    commands until the timeout has expired in order to avoid any resets due
    to failed commands on another device.

    libata: implement slave_link
    
    Explanation taken from the comment of ata_slave_link_init().
    
     In libata, a port contains links and a link contains devices.  There
     is single host link but if a PMP is attached to it, there can be
     multiple fan-out links.  On SATA, there's usually a single device
     connected to a link but PATA and SATA controllers emulating TF based
     interface can have two - master and slave.
    
     However, there are a few controllers which don't fit into this
     abstraction too well - SATA controllers which emulate TF interface
     with both master and slave devices but also have separate SCR
     register sets for each device.  These controllers need separate links
     for physical link handling (e.g. onlineness, link speed) but should
     be treated like a traditional M/S controller for everything else
     (e.g. command issue, softreset).
    
     slave_link is libata's way of handling this class of controllers
     without impacting core layer too much.  For anything other than
     physical link handling, the default host link is used for both master
     and slave.  For physical link handling, separate @ap->slave_link is
     used.  All dirty details are implemented inside libata core layer.
     From LLD's POV, the only difference is that prereset, hardreset and
     postreset are called once more for the slave link, so the reset
     sequence looks like the following.
    
     prereset(M) -> prereset(S) -> hardreset(M) -> hardreset(S) ->
     softreset(M) -> postreset(M) -> postreset(S)
    
     Note that softreset is called only for the master.  Softreset resets
     both M/S by definition, so SRST on master should handle both (the
     standard method will work just fine).
    
    As slave_link excludes PMP support and only code paths which deal with
    the attributes of physical link are affected, all the changes are
    localized to libata.h, libata-core.c and libata-eh.c.
    
     * ata_is_host_link() updated so that slave_link is considered as host
       link too.
    
     * iterator extended to iterate over the slave_link when using the
       underbarred version.
    
     * force param handling updated such that devno 16 is mapped to the
       slave link/device.
    
     * ata_link_on/offline() updated to return the combined result from
       master and slave link.  ata_phys_link_on/offline() are the direct
       versions.
    
     * EH autopsy and report are performed separately for master slave
       links.  Reset is udpated to implement the above described reset
       sequence.
    
    Except for reset update, most changes are minor, many of them just
    modifying dev->link to ata_dev_phys_link(dev) or using phys online
    test instead.
    
    After this update, LLDs can take full advantage of per-dev SCR
    registers by simply turning on slave link.

    libata: make SCR access ops per-link
    
    Logically, SCR access ops should take @link; however, there was no
    compelling reason to convert all SCR access ops when adding @link
    abstraction as there's one-to-one mapping between a port and a non-PMP
    link.  However, that assumption won't hold anymore with the scheduled
    addition of slave link.

    it assumes that the EBDA is 65000 bytes. But BIOS EBDA pointers are

    _if_ the Rio code truly extends upon the customary EBDA size it needs
    to iounmap() this memory and ioremap() it larger, once it knows it from
    the generic descriptors that a Rio system is around.

    GFS2: Support for I/O barriers
    
    This patch adds barrier support to GFS2. There is not a lot of change
    really... we just add the barrier flag when we write journal header
    blocks. If the underlying device refuses to support them, we fall back
    to the previous way of doing things (wait for the I/O and hope) since
    there is nothing else we can do. There is no user configuration,
    barriers will always be on unless the device refuses to support them.
    This seems a reasonable solution to me since this is a correctness
    issue.

    Go through the iomem resource tree to check if any of the ioremap()
    requests span more than any slot in the iomem resource tree and do
    a WARN_ON() if we hit this check.

    IPoIB: Fix crash when path record fails after path flush
    
    Commit ee1e2c82 ("IPoIB: Refresh paths instead of flushing them on SM
    change events") changed how paths are flushed on an SM event.  This
    change introduces a problem if the path record query triggered by
    fails, causing path->ah to become NULL.  A later successful path query
    will then trigger WARN_ON() in path_rec_completion(), and crash
    because path->ah has already been freed, so the ipoib_put_ah() inside
    the lock in path_rec_completion() may actually drop the last reference
    (contrary to the comment that claims this is safe).
    
    Fix this by updating path->ah and freeing old_ah only when the path
    record query is successful.  This prevents the neighbour AH and that
    path AH from getting out of sync.
    
    This fixes <https://bugs.openfabrics.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1194>

    [ARM] Introduce new bitmask based cache type macros
    
    Rather than trying to (inaccurately) decode the cache type from the
    registers each time we need to decide what type of cache we have,
    use a bitmask initialized early during boot.
    
    Since the setup is a one-off initialization, we can be a little more
    clever and take account of the CPU architecture as well.
    
    Note that we continue to achieve the compactness on optimised kernels
    by forcing tests to always-false or always-true as appropriate, thereby
    allowing the compiler to do build-time code elimination.

    [ARM] Remove cache type printks
    
    The cache type register found in ARMv5 and later CPUs changes format
    and meaning depending on the CPU architecture version.  Currently,
    this code:
    a) doesn't work for everything - Xscale's are identified as
       'unknown 5'.
    b) is not able to tell whether the caches are VIVT or VIPT from the
       cache type.
    c) prints rubbish on some ARMv6 and ARMv7+ CPUs.
    
    The two solutions to this are:
    1. Add yet more code to decode and print the various different register
       formats.
    2. Remove the code altogther.
    
    The code only exists to decode and print the cache parameters.
    Increasing the complexity of it just for the sake of a few prinks
    isn't worth it.

    x86: restore old GART alloc_coherent behavior
    
    Currently, GART alloc_coherent tries to allocate pages with GFP_DMA32
    for a device having dma_masks > 24bit < 32bits. If GART gets an
    address that a device can't access to, GART try to map the address to
    a virtual I/O address that the device can access to.
    
    But Andi pointed out, "The GART is somewhere in the 4GB range so you
    cannot use it to map anything < 4GB. Also GART is pretty small."
    
    http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/9/12/43
    
    That is, it's possible that GART doesn't have virtual I/O address
    space that a device can access to. The above behavior doesn't work for
    a device having dma_masks > 24bit < 32bits.

        x86: make GART to respect device's dma_mask about virtual mappings
    
    I wrote the above commit to fix a GART alloc_coherent regression, that
    can't handle a device having dma_masks > 24bit < 32bits, introduced by
    the alloc_coherent rewrite:
    
      http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/8/12/200
    
    After the alloc_coherent rewrite, GART alloc_coherent tried to
    allocate pages with GFP_DMA32. If GART got an address that a device
    can't access to, GART mapped the address to a virtual I/O address. But
    GART mapping mechanism didn't take account of dma mask, so GART could
    use a virtual I/O address that the device can't access to again.
    
    Alan pointed out:
    
    " This is indeed a specific problem found with things like older
      AACRAID where control blocks must be below 31bits and the GART
      is above 0x80000000. "
    
    The above commit modified GART mapping mechanism to take care of dma
    mask. But Andi pointed out, "The GART is somewhere in the 4GB range so
    you cannot use it to map anything < 4GB. Also GART is pretty small."
    
    http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/9/12/43
    
    That means it's possible that GART doesn't have virtual I/O address
    space that a device can access to. The above commit (to modify GART
    mapping mechanism to take care of dma mask) can't fix the regression
    reliably so let's avoid making GART more complicated.
    
    We need a solution that always works for dma_masks > 24bit <
    32bits. That's how GART worked before the alloc_coherent rewrite.

    [ARM] pxa: introduce cpu_is_pxa26x()
    
    PXA26x (PXA261/262) is actually a PXA250 with stacked Intel(R)
    StartaFlash. And this can be decided by bit 3 (PKG_TYPE) of
    BOOT_DEF register.
    
    Due to this extra I/O register access, make cpu_is_pxa26x() a
    public function instead of a macro.

    e1000e: avoid duplicated output of device name in kernel warning
    
    With 2.6.27-rc3 I noticed the following messages in my boot log:
    
    0000:01:00.0: 0000:01:00.0: Warning: detected DSPD enabled in EEPROM
    0000:01:00.0: eth0: (PCI Express:2.5GB/s:Width x1) 00:16:76:04:ff:09
    
    The second seems correct, but the first has a silly repetition of the
    PCI device before the actual message. The message originates from
    e1000_eeprom_checks in e1000e/netdev.c.
    
    With this patch below the first message becomes
    
      e1000e 0000:01:00.0: Warning: detected DSPD enabled in EEPROM
    
    which makes it similar to directly preceding messages.
    
    Use dev_warn instead of e_warn in e1000_eeprom_checks() as the interface
    name has not yet been assigned at that point.

    ne.c: fix rmmod, platform driver improvements
    
    Removing the module would cause a kernel oops as platform_driver_probe
    failed to detect a device and unregistered the platform driver on module
    init, and cleanup_module would unregister the already unregistered driver.
    The suspend and resume functions weren't being called.
    
    platform_driver support was added earlier, but without any
    platform_device_register* calls I don't think it was being used.  Now all
    devices are registered using platform_device_register_simple and pointers
    are kept to unregister the ones that the probe failed for or unregister
    all devices on module shutdown.  init_module no longer calls ne_init to
    reduce confusion (and multiple unregister paths that caused the rmmod
    oops).  With the devices now registered they are added to the platform
    driver and get suspend and resume events.
    
    netif_device_detach(dev) was added before unregister_netdev(dev) when
    removing the region as occationally I would see a race condition where the
    device was still being used in unregister_netdev.

    gianfar: Fix error in mdio reset timeout
    
    The loop with the timeout used "while (...  && timeout--)", which means
    than when the timeout occurs, "timeout" will be -1 after the loop has
    exited.  The code that checks if the looped exited because of a timeout
    used "if (timeout <= 0)".  Seems ok, except timeout is unsigned, and
    (unsigned)-1 isn't less than zero!
    
    Using "--timeout" in the loop fixes this problem, as now "timeout" will be
    0 when the loop times out.
    
    This also fixes a bug in the existing code, where it will erroneously think
    a timeout occurred if the condition the loop was waiting for is satisfied
    on the final iteration before a timeout.

    Check if the link is available when a changed interrupt has been received and
    set the carrier status appropriately.  The code is copied nearly verbatim from
    the dl2k module.  The link status could be used in more places in the driver,
    but this is enough to get the carrier status reported to userspace.  Fixes

    8139too: [cosmetic] fix incorrect register for flash-rom
    
    I would like to submit a correction to the driver
    
         drivers/net/8139too.c,
    
    which in no way changes the compiled driver, but does change
    the value of a previously incorrect value for the configuration
    register address of Flash PROM on the network processor rtl8139C.
    This corrected value is in accordance with the datasheet
    for rtl8139C, and in addition this new value is indeed used
    in other functional drivers that use this adapter for
    programming a Flash memory chip in situ. But as said,
    the two new constants are never referenced in the driver
    maintained by you: they are only informational and correct!

    [netdrvr] atl1e: Don't take the mdio_lock in atl1e_probe
    
    Lockdep warns about the mdio_lock taken with interrupts enabled then later
    taken from interrupt context.  Initially, I considered changing these
    to spin_lock_irq/spin_unlock_irq, but then I looked at atl1e_phy_init()
    and saw that it calls msleep().  Sleeping while holding a spinlock is
    not allowed either.
    
    In the probe path, we haven't registered the interrupt handler, so
    it can't poke at this card yet.  It's before we call register_netdev(),
    so I don't think any other threads can reach this card either.  If I'm
    right, we don't need a spinlock at all.

    smc91x: SMC_IO_SHIFT platform data support for default case
    
    Commit 159198862adad7109bb347bb30a620f67beac45f added SMC_IO_SHIFT
    platform data support. After that ARM board support was added.
    
    The default case is still missing though, so on SuperH SMC_IO_SHIFT
    is constantly zero regardless of what you pass as platform data.

    The de2104x did a pci_disable_device() in it's close function, but
    the open function never does a pci_enable_device() and assumes that
    the device is already enabled. Considering that downing the interface
    is just a temporary thing the pci_disable_device() isn't a pretty good

    POWERPC: Allow 32-bit hashed pgtable code to support 36-bit physical
    
    This rearranges a bit of code, and adds support for
    36-bit physical addressing for configs that use a
    hashed page table.  The 36b physical support is not
    enabled by default on any config - it must be
    explicitly enabled via the config system.
    
    This patch *only* expands the page table code to accomodate
    large physical addresses on 32-bit systems and enables the
    PHYS_64BIT config option for 86xx.  It does *not*
    allow you to boot a board with more than about 3.5GB of
    RAM - for that, SWIOTLB support is also required (and
    coming soon).

    powerpc: Introduce local (non-broadcast) forms of tlb invalidates
    
    Introduced a new set of low level tlb invalidate functions that do not
    broadcast invalidates on the bus:
    
    _tlbil_all - invalidate all
    _tlbil_pid - invalidate based on process id (or mm context)
    _tlbil_va  - invalidate based on virtual address (ea + pid)
    
    On non-SMP configs _tlbil_all should be functionally equivalent to _tlbia and
    _tlbil_va should be functionally equivalent to _tlbie.
    
    The intent of this change is to handle SMP based invalidates via IPIs instead
    of broadcasts as the mechanism scales better for larger number of cores.
    
    On e500 (fsl-booke mmu) based cores move to using MMUCSR for invalidate alls
    and tlbsx/tlbwe for invalidate virtual address.

    powerpc: Merge 32 and 64-bit dma code
    
    We essentially adopt the 64-bit dma code, with some changes to support
    32-bit systems, including HIGHMEM.  dma functions on 32-bit are now
    invoked via accessor functions which call the correct op for a device based
    on archdata dma_ops.  If there is no archdata dma_ops, this defaults
    to dma_direct_ops.
    
    In addition, the dma_map/unmap_page functions are added to dma_ops
    because we can't just fall back on map/unmap_single when HIGHMEM is
    enabled. In the case of dma_direct_*, we stop using map/unmap_single
    and just use the page version - this saves a lot of ugly
    ifdeffing.  We leave map/unmap_single in the dma_ops definition,
    though, because they are needed by the iommu code, which does not
    implement map/unmap_page.  Ideally, going forward, we will completely
    eliminate map/unmap_single and just have map/unmap_page, if it's
    workable for 64-bit.

    cifs: explicitly revoke SPNEGO key after session setup
    
    The SPNEGO blob returned by an upcall can only be used once. Explicitly

    This doesn't seem to be that big an issue on more recent kernels, but

    That said, explicitly revoking the key seems like a reasonable thing

    This patch removes the HT flags from RXON when moving from HT to legacy.
    This avoids keeping those flags set and possibly miss configuring firmware.
    
    If we are configured in HT, fat channel: channel 1 above, and move later
    to legacy channel 11, we need to clear the FAT channel control flags in
    RXON. If we don't, the firmware will understand this as channel 11 above
    which is not possible due to regulatory constraints, leading to firmware
    crash.

    mac80211: make master iface not wireless
    
    There's no need to register the master netdev with cfg80211,
    in fact, this is quite dangerous and lead to having to add
    checks for the master interface all over the config handlers.
    This patch removes the "ieee80211_ptr" from the master iface
    in favour of having a small netdev_priv() associated with
    the master interface that stores the ieee80211_local pointer.
    Because of this, a lot of code in the configuration handlers
    can go away. To make this patch easier to verify I have also
    removed a number of wiphy_priv() calls in favour of getting
    the sdata first and then the local pointer from that.

    wireless: Read scan flags correctly on x86-64
    
    The SIOCSIWSCAN handler is passed data in an iw_point structure. Some
    drivers erronously use an iw_param instead.
    
    On 32 bit architectures the difference isn't noticed as the flags
    parameter tends to be the only one used by scan handlers and is at the
    same offset.
    
    On 64 bit architectures the pointer in the iw_point structure means the
    flag parameter is at different offsets in these structures.
    
    Thanks to Jean Tourrilhes for tracking this down for orinoco, and Pavel
    Roskin for confirming the fix and identifying other suspect handlers.

    cifs: work around samba returning -ENOENT on SetFileDisposition call
    
    cifs: work around samba returning -ENOENT on SetFileDisposition call
    
    Samba seems to return STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND when we try to set
    the delete on close bit after doing a rename by filehandle. This looks
    like a samba bug to me, but a lot of servers will do this. For now,
    pretend an -ENOENT return is a success.
    
    Samba does however seem to respect the CREATE_DELETE_ON_CLOSE bit
    when opening files that already exist. Windows will ignore it, but
    so adding it to the open flags should be harmless.
    
    We're also currently ignoring the return code on the rename by
    filehandle, so no need to set rc based on it.

    x86, olpc: fix endian bug in openfirmware workaround
    
    Boardrev is always treated as a u32 everywhere else, no reason to
    byteswap the 0xc2 value.  The only use is to print out if it is
    a prerelease board, the test being:
    
    (olpc_platform_info.boardrev & 0xf) < 8
    
    Which is currently always true as be32_to_cpu(0xc2) & 0xf = 0
    but I doubt that was the intention here.  The consequences of the bug
    are pretty minor though (incorrect boardrev displayed in dmesg when
    ofw support not configured)
    
    Also annotate the temporary used to read the boardrev in the ofw
    case.
    
    The confusion was noticed by Sparse:

    aoe: Fix OOPS after SKB queue changes.
    
    Reported by Thomas Graf.
    
    If we don't unlink the SKB from the queue when we send it
    out in aoenet_xmit(), dev_hard_start_xmit() will see skb->next
    as non-NULL and interpret this to mean the SKB is part of a

    ext4: Combine proc file handling into a single set of functions
    
    Previously mballoc created a separate set of functions for each proc
    file.  This combines the tunables into a single set of functions which
    gets used for all of the per-superblock proc files, saving
    approximately 2k of compiled object code.

    [CIFS]  fix busy-file renames and refactor cifs_rename logic
    
    Break out the code that does the actual renaming into a separate
    function and have cifs_rename call that. That function will attempt a
    path based rename first and then do a filehandle based one if it looks
    like the source is busy.
    
    The existing logic tried a path based rename first, but if we needed to
    remove the destination then it only attempted a filehandle based rename
    afterward. Not all servers support renaming by filehandle, so we need to
    always attempt path rename first and fall back to filehandle rename if
    it doesn't work.
    
    This also fixes renames of open files on windows servers (at least when
    the source and destination directories are the same).

    powerpc: convert CONFIG_PPC_MERGE to CONFIG_PPC for legacy io checks
    
    Now that arch/ppc is dead CONFIG_PPC_MERGE is always defined for all
    powerpc platforms and we want to get rid of CONFIG_PPC_MERGE use
    CONFIG_PPC instead.

    signals: demultiplexing SIGTRAP signal
    
    Currently a SIGTRAP can denote any one of below reasons.
    	- Breakpoint hit
    	- H/W debug register hit
    	- Single step
    	- Signal sent through kill() or rasie()
    
    Architectures like powerpc/parisc provides infrastructure to demultiplex
    SIGTRAP signal by passing down the information for receiving SIGTRAP through
    si_code of siginfot_t structure. Here is an attempt is generalise this
    infrastructure by extending it to x86 and x86_64 archs.

    mainly prevented requeuing loop with __netif_schedule(), but now it's

    ALSA: HDA VIA: Replace buggy Mic Boost
    
    VT1708S' Mic Boost should be hidden in hardware design according to some
    customers' requirements.  However, in case of bugs, it has to be exhibited to
    normal users, so we need to:
    * open a software backdoor, which is disabled by default in hardware
    * re-write .tlv & .info, to indicate the actual necessary info, which we cannot
      get from amplifier's capabiliies

    ALSA: HDA VIA: Fix 2nd S/PDIF out function
    
    As it seems, the recently-sent patch for the 2nd S/PDIF (HDMI) output
    is not working with alsa-kernel 1.0.18rc3.
    
    This patch makes it work by
    * activating the second S/PDIF output pin in the pin config
    * consolidating the dig_playback_pcm_prepare() with extra_dig_pcm_prepare()
      functions
    * remove the need for an extra hda_pcm_stream structure and rather represents
      the second digital output as substream within the primary S/PDIF digital out
      stream.

    Don't use __init but __devinit to define probe function.  A pointer to
    snd_aica_probe is passed to the core via platform_driver_register and so the
    function must not disappear after the module is loaded.  Using __init
    and having HOTPLUG=y and SND_AICA=m the following probably oopses:
    
    	echo -n AICA > /sys/bus/platform/driver/AICA/unbind
    	echo -n AICA > /sys/bus/platform/driver/AICA/bind
    
    Strange enough add_aicamixer_controls which is only called by

    net: network device name ifalias support
    
    This patch add support for keeping an additional character alias
    associated with an network interface. This is useful for maintaining
    the SNMP ifAlias value which is a user defined value. Routers use this
    to hold information like which circuit or line it is connected to. It
    is just an arbitrary text label on the network device.
    
    There are two exposed interfaces with this patch, the value can be
    read/written either via netlink or sysfs.
    
    This could be maintained just by the snmp daemon, but it is more
    generally useful for other management tools, and the kernel is good
    place to act as an agreed upon interface to store it.

    ipsec: Fix xfrm_state_walk race
    
    As discovered by Timo Teräs, the currently xfrm_state_walk scheme
    is racy because if a second dump finishes before the first, we
    may free xfrm states that the first dump would walk over later.
    
    This patch fixes this by storing the dumps in a list in order
    to calculate the correct completion counter which cures this
    problem.
    
    I've expanded netlink_cb in order to accomodate the extra state
    related to this.  It shouldn't be a big deal since netlink_cb
    is kmalloced for each dump and we're just increasing it by 4 or
    8 bytes.

    cifs: have find_writeable_file prefer filehandles opened by same task
    
    When the CIFS client goes to write out pages, it needs to pick a
    filehandle to write to. find_writeable_file however just picks the
    first filehandle that it finds. This can cause problems when a lock
    is issued against a particular filehandle and we pick a different
    filehandle to write to.
    
    This patch tries to avert this situation by having find_writable_file
    prefer filehandles that have a pid that matches the current task.
    This seems to fix lock test 11 from the connectathon test suite when
    run against a windows server.

    x86, NMI watchdog: setup before enabling NMI watchdog
    
    There's a small window when NMI watchdog is being set up that if any NMIs
    are triggered, the NMI code will make make use of not initalized wd_ops
    elements:
    	void setup_apic_nmi_watchdog(void *unused)
    	{
    		if (__get_cpu_var(wd_enabled))
    			return;
    
    		/* cheap hack to support suspend/resume */
    		/* if cpu0 is not active neither should the other cpus */
    		if (smp_processor_id() != 0 && atomic_read(&nmi_active) <= 0)
    			return;
    
    		switch (nmi_watchdog) {
    		case NMI_LOCAL_APIC:
    			/* enable it before to avoid race with handler */
    -->			__get_cpu_var(wd_enabled) = 1;
    -->			if (lapic_watchdog_init(nmi_hz) < 0) {
    (...)
    	asmlinkage notrace __kprobes void default_do_nmi(struct pt_regs *regs)
    	{
    	(...)
    			if (nmi_watchdog_tick(regs, reason))
    				return;
    (...)
    	notrace __kprobes int
    	nmi_watchdog_tick(struct pt_regs *regs, unsigned reason)
    	{
    	(...)
    		if (!__get_cpu_var(wd_enabled))
    			return rc;
    		switch (nmi_watchdog) {
    		case NMI_LOCAL_APIC:
    			rc |= lapic_wd_event(nmi_hz);
    (...)
    int lapic_wd_event(unsigned nmi_hz)
    {
    	struct nmi_watchdog_ctlblk *wd = &__get_cpu_var(nmi_watchdog_ctlblk);
    	u64 ctr;
    
    -->	rdmsrl(wd->perfctr_msr, ctr);
    
    and wd->*_msr will be initialized on each processor type specific setup, after
    enabling NMIs for PMIs. Since the counter was just set, the chances of an
    performance counter generated NMI is minimal, but any other unknown NMI would
    trigger the problem. This patch fixes the problem by setting everything up
    before enabling performance counter generated NMIs and will set wd_enabled
    using a callback function.

    x86, NMI watchdog: when booting with reset_devices, clear the performance counters
    
    P4s have a quirk that makes necessary to clear P4_CCCR_OVF bit on the CCCR
    everytime the PMI is triggered. When booting the kernel with reset_devices
    (more specific kdump case), the counters reach zero and the PMI will be
    generated. This is not a problem on other processors but on P4s, it'll
    continue to generate NMIs until that bit is cleared. Since there may be
    other users of the performance counters, clear and disable all of them
    when booting with reset_devices option.
    
    We have a P4 box here that crashes because of this problem. Since the kdump
    kernel usually boots with only one processor active, the second logical
    unit won't be set up, therefore, MSR_P4_IQ_CCCR1 (and other performance
    counter registers) won't be cleared and P4_CCCR_OVF may be still set because
    the previous kernel was using this register. An NMI is triggered because of
    the MSR_P4_IQ_CCCR1 right after the NMI delivery is enabled, triggering the
    race fixed on my previous email.

    sched: wakeup preempt when small overlap
    
    Lin Ming reported a 10% OLTP regression against 2.6.27-rc4.
    
    The difference seems to come from different preemption agressiveness,
    which affects the cache footprint of the workload and its effective
    cache trashing.
    
    Aggresively preempt a task if its avg overlap is very small, this should
    avoid the task going to sleep and find it still running when we schedule
    back to it - saving a wakeup.

    ALSA: oxygen: configure MIDI via device_config
    
    To enable the MIDI port, model drivers must now set flags in
    device_config, not only in misc_flags.  This allows model drivers to
    enable the UART without creating an ALSA MIDI device.

    ALSA: virtuoso: handle D2X/DX dynamically
    
    The Xonar D2X and DX are very similar to the D2 and D1, respectively, so
    we can handle the differences dynamically instead of using a separate
    model structure for each one.

    GFS2: Add UUID to GFS2 sb
    
    This patch adds a UUID to the GFS2 sb structure. This field is not
    actually referenced from kernel space at all, but is added for
    completeness and due to the userland tools which get their on-disk
    structure information from the gfs2_ondisk.h header file.
    
    Since we have to be backwards compatible, we will assume that any GFS2
    sb for which the UUID is all 0 does not have a UUID as such.
    
    We should then be (after some userland changes) able to support the -U
    mount option. This addresses Fedora bugzilla #242689

    ipvs: Restrict sync message to 255 connections
    
    The nr_conns variable in the sync message header is only eight bits wide
    and will overflow on interfaces with a large MTU. As a result the backup
    won't parse all connections contained in the sync buffer. On regular
    ethernet with an MTU of 1500 this isn't a problem, because we can't
    overflow the value, but consider jumbo frames being used on a cross-over
    connection between both directors.
    
    We now restrict the size of the sync buffer, so that we never put more
    than 255 connections into a single sync buffer.

    tcp: advertise MSS requested by user
    
    I'm trying to use the TCP_MAXSEG option to setsockopt() to set the MSS
    for both sides of a bidirectional connection.
    
    man tcp says: "If this option is set before connection establishment, it
    also changes the MSS value announced to the other end in the initial
    packet."
    
    However, the kernel only uses the MTU/route cache to set the advertised
    MSS. That means if I set the MSS to, say, 500 before calling connect(),
    I will send at most 500-byte packets, but I will still receive 1500-byte
    packets in reply.
    
    This is a bug, either in the kernel or the documentation.
    
    This patch (applies to latest net-2.6) reduces the advertised value to
    that requested by the user as long as setsockopt() is called before
    connect() or accept(). This seems like the behavior that one would
    expect as well as that which is documented.
    
    I've tried to make sure that things that depend on the advertised MSS
    are set correctly.

    tcp: don't clear lost_skb_hint when not necessary
    
    Most importantly avoid doing it with cumulative ACK. However,
    since we have lost_cnt_hint in the picture as well needing
    adjustments, it's not as trivial as dealing with
    retransmit_skb_hint (and cannot be done in the all place we
    could trivially leave retransmit_skb_hint untouched).
    
    With the previous patch, this should mostly remove O(n^2)
    behavior while cumulative ACKs start flowing once rexmit
    after a lossy round-trip made it through.

    tcp: don't clear retransmit_skb_hint when not necessary
    
    Most importantly avoid doing it with cumulative ACK. Not clearing
    means that we no longer need n^2 processing in resolution of each
    fast recovery.

    This doesn't much sense here afaict, probably never has. Since
    fragmenting and collapsing deal the hints by themselves, there
    should be very little reason for the rexmit loop to do that.

    I suspect it might have been related to the changed amount

    The place for this clearing was very illogical anyway,

    tcp: convert retransmit_cnt_hint to seqno
    
    Main benefit in this is that we can then freely point
    the retransmit_skb_hint to anywhere we want to because
    there's no longer need to know what would be the count
    changes involve, and since this is really used only as a
    terminator, unnecessary work is one time walk at most,
    and if some retransmissions are necessary after that
    point later on, the walk is not full waste of time
    anyway.
    
    Since retransmit_high must be kept valid, all lost
    markers must ensure that.
    
    Now I also have learned how those "holes" in the
    rexmittable skbs can appear, mtu probe does them. So
    I removed the misleading comment as well.

    IB/ehca: Generate flush status CQ entries
    
    When a QP goes into error state, it is required that CQ entries with a
    flush error status are delivered to the application for any
    outstanding work requests.  eHCA does not do this in hardware, so this
    patch adds software flush CQE generation to the ehca driver.
    
    Whenever a QP gets into error state, it is added to the QP error list
    of its respective CQ.  If the error QP list of a CQ is not empty,
    poll_cq() generates flush CQEs before polling the actual CQ.

    dev->coherent_dma_mask if it is set.

    GFS2: high time to take some time over atime
    
    Until now, we've used the same scheme as GFS1 for atime. This has failed
    since atime is a per vfsmnt flag, not a per fs flag and as such the
    "noatime" flag was not getting passed down to the filesystems. This
    patch removes all the "special casing" around atime updates and we
    simply use the VFS's atime code.
    
    The net result is that GFS2 will now support all the same atime related
    mount options of any other filesystem on a per-vfsmnt basis. We do lose
    the "lazy atime" updates, but we gain "relatime". We could add lazy
    atime to the VFS at a later date, if there is a requirement for that
    variant still - I suspect relatime will be enough.
    
    Also we lose about 100 lines of code after this patch has been applied,
    and I have a suspicion that it will speed things up a bit, even when
    atime is "on". So it seems like a nice clean up as well.
    
    From a user perspective, everything stays the same except the loss of
    the per-fs atime quantum tweekable (ought to be per-vfsmnt at the very
    least, and to be honest I don't think anybody ever used it) and that a
    number of options which were ignored before now work correctly.
    
    Please let me know if you've got any comments. I'm pushing this out
    early so that you can all see what my plans are.

    GFS2: The war on bloat
    
    The following patch shrinks the gfs2_args structure which is embedded in
    every GFS2 superblock. It cuts down the size of the options to a single
    unsigned int (the 13 bits of bitfields will be rounded up to that size
    by the compiler) from the current 11 unsigned ints. So on x86 thats 44
    bytes shrinking to 4 bytes, in each and every GFS2 superblock.

    ARM: DaVinci: evm sets up many devices
    
    Update DaVinci EVM board setup to work with key drivers which are
    now in mainline kernels:
    
     - I2C adapter (driver: i2c_davinci)
        * three gpio expanders (driver: pcf8574) used for
           - LEDs
           - audio codec control
           - misc device control (including USB VBUS, IDE-vs-CF)
        * at24 (driver: at24) eeprom
     - USB controller (driver: musb_hdrc)
     - IDE controller (driver: palm_bk3710)
    
    This board is the first in-tree client for a number of those drivers,
    and adding this board support means the EVM board can be used for some
    "real work" ... excepting "DaVinci Technology" video and DSP support
    (also available in most OMAP3 chips).
    
    Also renames the flash as "evm_norflash", since NAND may be jumpered.

    The CPM1 GPIO library code uses the non thread-safe clrbits32/setbits32
    macros. This patch protects them with a spinlock.
    
    Based on the CPM2 patch from Laurent Pinchart <laurentp@cse-semaphore.com>,

    math-emu: Add support for reporting exact invalid exception
    
    Some architectures (like powerpc) provide status information on the exact
    type of invalid exception.  This is pretty straight forward as we already
    report invalid exceptions via FP_SET_EXCEPTION.
    
    We add new flags (FP_EX_INVALID_*) the architecture code can define if it
    wants the exact invalid exception reported.
    
    We had to split out the INF/INF and 0/0 cases for divide to allow reporting
    the two invalid forms properly.

    x86: add X86_RESERVE_LOW_64K
    
    This bugzilla:
    
      http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11237
    
    Documents a wide range of systems where the BIOS utilizes the first
    64K of physical memory during suspend/resume and other hardware events.
    
    Currently we reserve this memory on all AMI and Phoenix BIOS systems.
    Life is too short to hunt subtle memory corruption problems like this,
    so we try to be robust by default.
    
    Still, allow this to be overriden: allow users who want that first 64K
    of memory to be available to the kernel disable the quirk, via
    CONFIG_X86_RESERVE_LOW_64K=n.
    
    Also, allow the early reservation to overlap with other
    early reservations.

    x86: reserve low 64K on AMI and Phoenix BIOS boxen
    
    there's multiple reports about suspend/resume related low memory
    corruption in this bugzilla:
    
      http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11237
    
    the common pattern is that the corruption is caused by the BIOS,
    and that it affects some portion of the first 64K of physical RAM.
    
    So add a DMI quirk
    
    This will waste 64K RAM on 'good' systems too, but without knowing
    the exact nature of this BIOS memory corruption this is the safest
    approach.
    
    This might as well solve a wide range of suspend/resume breakages
    under Linux.

    x86: add DMI quirk for AMI BIOS which corrupts address 0xc000 during resume
    
    Alan Jenkins and Andy Wettstein reported a suspend/resume memory
    corruption bug and extensively documented it here:
    
       http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11237
    
    The bug is that the BIOS overwrites 1K of memory at 0xc000 physical,
    without registering it in e820 as reserved or giving the kernel any
    idea about this.
    
    Detect AMI BIOSen and reserve that 1K.
    
    We paint this bug around with a very broad brush (reserving that 1K on all
    AMI BIOS systems), as the bug was extremely hard to find and needed several
    weeks and lots of debugging and patching.
    
    The bug was found via the CONFIG_X86_CHECK_BIOS_CORRUPTION=y debug feature,
    if similar bugs are suspected then this feature can be enabled on other
    systems as well to scan low memory for corrupted memory.

    mac80211: fix virtual interfaces vs. injection
    
    Currently, virtual interface pointers passed to drivers might be
    from monitor interfaces and as such completely uninitialised
    because we do not tell the driver about monitor interfaces when
    those are created. Instead of passing them, we should therefore
    indicate to the driver that there is no information; do that by
    passing a NULL value and adjust drivers to cope with it.
    
    As a result, some mac80211 API functions also need to cope with
    a NULL vif pointer so drivers can still call them unconditionally.
    
    Also, when injecting frames we really don't want to pass NULL all
    the time, if we know we are the source address of a frame and have
    a local interface for that address, we can to use that interface.
    This also helps with processing the frame correctly for that
    interface which will help the 802.11w implementation. It's not
    entirely correct for VLANs or WDS interfaces because there the MAC
    address isn't unique, but it's already a lot better than what we
    do now.
    
    Finally, when injecting without a matching local interface, don't
    assign sequence numbers at all.

    libertas: Reduce the WPA key installation time.
    
    WPA requires that the PTK is installed immediately after the 4-way handshake
    in order to properly decrypt the subsequent incoming EAPOL-GTK frame.  If the
    PTK is not enabled by the time the EAPOL-GTK frame arrives, the frame is
    dropped and the supplicant does not receive the group key.
    
    This will happen with fast Access Points that send the EAPOL-GTK frame before
    the suplicant has successfully installed and enabled the PTK.  To mitigate
    this situation, this patch simplifies and accelerates the SIOCSIWENCODEEXT
    execution.

    rfkill: remove transmitter blocking on suspend
    
    Currently, rfkill would stand in the way of properly supporting wireless
    devices that are capable of waking the system up from sleep or hibernation
    when they receive a special wireless message.  It would also get in the way
    of mesh devices that need to remain operational even during platform
    suspend.
    
    To avoid that, stop trying to block the transmitters on the rfkill class
    suspend handler.
    
    Drivers that need rfkill's older behaviour will have to implement it by
    themselves in their own suspend handling.
    
    Do note that rfkill *will* attempt to restore the transmitter state on
    resume in any situation.  This happens after the driver's resume method is
    called by the suspend core (class devices resume after the devices they are
    attached to have been resumed).
    
    The following drivers need to check if they need to explicitly block
    their transmitters in their own suspend handlers (maintainers Cc'd):

    mac80211: small rate control changes
    
    This patch fixes mac80211 to not rely on the rate control
    algorithm to update sta->tx_retry_failed and sta->tx_retry_count
    (even if we don't currently use them), removes a number of
    completely unused values we don't even show in debugfs and
    changes the code in ieee80211_tx_status() to not look up the
    sta_info repeatedly.
    
    The only behaviour change here would be not calling the rate
    control function rate_control_tx_status() when no sta_info is
    found, but all rate control algorithms ignore such calls anyway.

    mac80211: fix scan vs. interface removal race
    
    When we remove an interface, we can currently end up having
    a pointer to it left in local->scan_sdata after it has been
    set down, and then with a hardware scan the scan completion
    can try to access it which is a bug. Alternatively, a scan
    that started as a hardware scan may terminate as though it
    was a software scan, if the timing is just right.
    
    On SMP systems, software scan also has a similar problem,
    just canceling the delayed work and setting a flag isn't
    enough since it may be running concurrently; in this case
    we would also never restore state of other interfaces.
    
    This patch hopefully fixes the problems by always invoking
    ieee80211_scan_completed or requiring it to be invoked by
    the driver, I suspect the drivers that have ->hw_scan() are
    buggy. The bug will not manifest itself unless you remove
    the interface while hw-scanning which will also turn off
    the hw, and then add a new interface which will be unusable
    until you scan once.

    mac80211: fix work race
    
    When we stop an interface, the work on it may still be pending

    protect against the work struct. The race is very unlikely to
    hit -- it'll happen only when the driver is using mac80211's
    workqueue to run long-running tasks and the sta/mesh works are
    delayed for quite a bit.
    
    This patch fixes it by cancelling the work explicitly.

    cfg80211: Add new wireless regulatory infrastructure
    
    This adds the new wireless regulatory infrastructure. The
    main motiviation behind this was to centralize regulatory
    code as each driver was implementing their own regulatory solution,
    and to replace the initial centralized code we have where:
    
    * only 3 regulatory domains are supported: US, JP and EU
    * regulatory domains can only be changed through module parameter
    * all rules were built statically in the kernel
    
    We now have support for regulatory domains for many countries
    and regulatory domains are now queried through a userspace agent
    through udev allowing distributions to update regulatory rules
    without updating the kernel.
    
    Each driver can regulatory_hint() a regulatory domain
    based on either their EEPROM mapped regulatory domain value to a
    respective ISO/IEC 3166-1 country code or pass an internally built
    regulatory domain. We also add support to let the user set the
    regulatory domain through userspace in case of faulty EEPROMs to
    further help compliance.
    
    Support for world roaming will be added soon for cards capable of
    this.
    
    For more information see:
    
    http://wireless.kernel.org/en/developers/Regulatory/CRDA
    
    For now we leave an option to enable the old module parameter,
    ieee80211_regdom, and to build the 3 old regdomains statically
    (US, JP and EU). This option is CONFIG_WIRELESS_OLD_REGULATORY.
    These old static definitions and the module parameter is being
    scheduled for removal for 2.6.29. Note that if you use this
    you won't make use of a world regulatory domain as its pointless.
    If you leave this option enabled and if CRDA is present and you
    use US or JP we will try to ask CRDA to update us a regulatory
    domain for us.

    problems, but it does mean that more levels of pagetable are allocated
    than makes sense for 16G pages.  The hugepage pagetables for the 16G
    pages are allocated much lower in the pagetable tree than they should
    be, with the intervening levels allocated with full pmd and pud pages
    which will only ever have one entry filled in.
    
    This corrects this problem, at the same time cleaning up the handling
    of which level 64k versus 16M hugepage pagetables are allocated at.
    The new way of formatting the tests should be more robust against
    changes in pagetable structure, or any newly added hugepage sizes.

    powerpc: Make the irq reverse mapping radix tree lockless
    
    The radix trees used by interrupt controllers for their irq reverse
    mapping (currently only the XICS found on pSeries) have a complex
    locking scheme dating back to before the advent of the lockless radix
    tree.
    
    This takes advantage of the lockless radix tree and of the fact that
    the items of the tree are pointers to a static array (irq_map)
    elements which can never go under us to simplify the locking.
    
    Concurrency between readers and writers is handled by the intrinsic
    properties of the lockless radix tree.  Concurrency between writers is
    handled with a global mutex.

    powerpc: Separate the irq radix tree insertion and lookup
    
    irq_radix_revmap() currently serves 2 purposes, irq mapping lookup
    and insertion which happen in interrupt and process context respectively.
    
    Separate the function into its 2 components, one for lookup only and one
    for insertion only.
    
    Fix the only user of the revmap tree (XICS) to use the new functions.
    
    Also, move the insertion into the radix tree of those irqs that were
    requested before it was initialized at said tree initialization.
    
    Mutual exclusion between the tree initialization and readers/writers is
    handled via a state variable (revmap_trees_allocated) set to 1 when the tree
    has been initialized and set to 2 after the already requested irqs have been
    inserted in the tree by the init path. This state is checked before any reader
    or writer access just like we used to check for tree.gfp_mask != 0 before.
    
    Finally, now that we're not any longer inserting nodes into the radix-tree
    in interrupt context, turn the GFP_ATOMIC allocations into GFP_KERNEL ones.

    powerpc: Make the 64-bit kernel as a position-independent executable
    
    This implements CONFIG_RELOCATABLE for 64-bit by making the kernel as
    a position-independent executable (PIE) when it is set.  This involves
    processing the dynamic relocations in the image in the early stages of
    booting, even if the kernel is being run at the address it is linked at,
    since the linker does not necessarily fill in words in the image for
    which there are dynamic relocations.  (In fact the linker does fill in
    such words for 64-bit executables, though not for 32-bit executables,
    so in principle we could avoid calling relocate() entirely when we're
    running a 64-bit kernel at the linked address.)
    
    The dynamic relocations are processed by a new function relocate(addr),
    where the addr parameter is the virtual address where the image will be
    run.  In fact we call it twice; once before calling prom_init, and again
    when starting the main kernel.  This means that reloc_offset() returns
    0 in prom_init (since it has been relocated to the address it is running
    at), which necessitated a few adjustments.
    
    This also changes __va and __pa to use an equivalent definition that is
    simpler.  With the relocatable kernel, PAGE_OFFSET and MEMORY_START are
    constants (for 64-bit) whereas PHYSICAL_START is a variable (and
    KERNELBASE ideally should be too, but isn't yet).
    
    With this, relocatable kernels still copy themselves down to physical
    address 0 and run there.

    powerpc: Use LOAD_REG_IMMEDIATE only for constants on 64-bit
    
    Using LOAD_REG_IMMEDIATE to get the address of kernel symbols
    generates 5 instructions where LOAD_REG_ADDR can do it in one,
    and will generate R_PPC64_ADDR16_* relocations in the output when
    we get to making the kernel as a position-independent executable,
    which we'd rather not have to handle.  This changes various bits
    of assembly code to use LOAD_REG_ADDR when we need to get the
    address of a symbol, or to use suitable position-independent code
    for cases where we can't access the TOC for various reasons, or
    if we're not running at the address we were linked at.
    
    It also cleans up a few minor things; there's no reason to save and
    restore SRR0/1 around RTAS calls, __mmu_off can get the return
    address from LR more conveniently than the caller can supply it in
    R4 (and we already assume elsewhere that EA == RA if the MMU is on
    in early boot), and enable_64b_mode was using 5 instructions where
    2 would do.

    powerpc: Make it possible to move the interrupt handlers away from the kernel
    
    This changes the way that the exception prologs transfer control to
    the handlers in 64-bit kernels with the aim of making it possible to
    have the prologs separate from the main body of the kernel.  Now,
    instead of computing the address of the handler by taking the top
    32 bits of the paca address (to get the 0xc0000000........ part) and
    ORing in something in the bottom 16 bits, we get the base address of
    the kernel by doing a load from the paca and add an offset.
    
    This also replaces an mfmsr and an ori to compute the MSR value for
    the handler with a load from the paca.  That makes it unnecessary to
    have a separate version of EXCEPTION_PROLOG_PSERIES that forces 64-bit
    mode.
    
    We can no longer use a direct branches in the exception prolog code,
    which means that the SLB miss handlers can't branch directly to
    .slb_miss_realmode any more.  Instead we have to compute the address
    and do an indirect branch.  This is conditional on CONFIG_RELOCATABLE;
    for non-relocatable kernels we use a direct branch as before.  (A later
    change will allow CONFIG_RELOCATABLE to be set on 64-bit powerpc.)
    
    Since the secondary CPUs on pSeries start execution in the first 0x100
    bytes of real memory and then have to get to wherever the kernel is,
    we can't use a direct branch to get there.  Instead this changes
    __secondary_hold_spinloop from a flag to a function pointer.  When it
    is set to a non-NULL value, the secondary CPUs jump to the function
    pointed to by that value.
    
    Finally this eliminates one code difference between 32-bit and 64-bit
    by making __secondary_hold be the text address of the secondary CPU
    spinloop rather than a function descriptor for it.

    powerpc: Add support for dynamic reconfiguration memory in kexec/kdump kernels
    
    Kdump kernel needs to use only those memory regions that it is allowed
    to use (crashkernel, rtas, tce, etc.).  Each of these regions have
    their own sizes and are currently added under 'linux,usable-memory'
    property under each memory@xxx node of the device tree.
    
    The ibm,dynamic-memory property of ibm,dynamic-reconfiguration-memory
    node (on POWER6) now stores in it the representation for most of the
    logical memory blocks with the size of each memory block being a
    constant (lmb_size).  If one or more or part of the above mentioned
    regions lie under one of the lmb from ibm,dynamic-memory property,
    there is a need to identify those regions within the given lmb.
    
    This makes the kernel recognize a new 'linux,drconf-usable-memory'
    property added by kexec-tools.  Each entry in this property is of the
    form of a count followed by that many (base, size) pairs for the above
    mentioned regions.  The number of cells in the count value is given by
    the #size-cells property of the root node.

    powerpc: New copy_4K_page()
    
    This new copy_4K_page() function was originally tuned for the best
    performance on the Cell processor, but after testing on more 64bit
    powerpc chips it was found that with a small modification it either
    matched the performance offered by the current mainline version or
    bettered it by a small amount.
    
    It was found that on a Cell-based QS22 blade the amount of system
    time measured when compiling a 2.6.26 pseries_defconfig decreased
    by 4%. Using the same test, a 4-way 970MP machine saw a decrease of
    2% in system time. No noticeable change was seen on Power4, Power5
    or Power6.
    
    The 4096 byte page is copied in thirty-two 128 byte strides. An
    initial setup loop executes dcbt instructions for the whole source
    page and dcbz instructions for the whole destination page. To do
    this, the cache line size is retrieved from ppc64_caches.
    
    A new CPU feature bit, CPU_FTR_CP_USE_DCBTZ, (introduced in the
    previous patch) is used to make the modification to this new copy
    routine - on Power4, 970 and Cell the feature bit is set so the
    setup loop is executed, but on all other 64bit chips the setup
    loop is nop'ed out.

    mv643xx_eth: avoid reading ->byte_cnt twice during receive processing
    
    Currently, the receive processing reads ->byte_cnt twice (once to
    update interface statistics and once to properly size the data area
    of the received skb), but since receive descriptors live in uncached
    memory, caching this value in a local variable saves one uncached
    access, and increases routing performance a tiny little bit more.

    mv643xx_eth: shrink default receive and transmit queue sizes
    
    Since the size of the receive queue is directly related to the data
    cache footprint of the driver (between refilling a receive ring entry
    with a fresh skb and receiving a packet in that entry, queue_size - 1
    other skbs will have been touched), shrink the default receive queue
    size to a saner number of entries, as 400 is definite overkill for
    almost all workloads.
    
    While we are at it, trim the default transmit queue size a bit as well.

    mv643xx_eth: avoid dropping tx lock during transmit reclaim
    
    By moving DMA unmapping during transmit reclaim back under the netif
    tx lock, we avoid the situation where we read the DMA address and buffer
    length from the descriptor under the lock and then not do anything with
    that data after dropping the lock on platforms where the DMA unmapping
    routines are all NOPs (which is the case on all ARM platforms that
    mv643xx_eth is used on at least).
    
    This saves two uncached reads, which makes a small but measurable
    performance difference in routing benchmarks.

    Since our ->hard_start_xmit() method is already called under spinlock
    protection (the netif tx queue lock), we can simply make that lock
    cover the private transmit state (descriptor ring indexes et al.) as
    well, which avoids having to use a private lock to protect that state.
    
    Since this was the last user of the driver-private spinlock, it can
    be killed off.

    This qdisc uses the skb->queue_mapping to select which band to place

    subqueue is stopped to determine which band to dequeue the packet from.

    tcp_ipv6: fix use of uninitialized memory
    
    inet6_rsk() is called on a struct request_sock * before we
    have checked whether the socket is an ipv6 socket or a ipv6-
    mapped ipv4 socket. The access that triggers this is the
    inet_rsk(rsk)->inet6_rsk_offset dereference in inet6_rsk().
    
    This is arguably not a critical error as the inet6_rsk_offset
    is only used to compute a pointer which is never really used
    (in the code path in question) anyway. But it might be a
    latent error, so let's fix it.

    net: fix scheduling of dst_gc_task by __dst_free
    
    The dst garbage collector dst_gc_task() may not be scheduled as we
    expect it to be in __dst_free().
    
    Indeed, when the dst_gc_timer was replaced by the delayed_work
    dst_gc_work, the mod_timer() call used to schedule the garbage
    collector at an earlier date was replaced by a schedule_delayed_work()
    (see commit 86bba269d08f0c545ae76c90b56727f65d62d57f).
    
    But, the behaviour of mod_timer() and schedule_delayed_work() is
    different in the way they handle the delay.
    
    mod_timer() stops the timer and re-arm it with the new given delay,
    whereas schedule_delayed_work() only check if the work is already
    queued in the workqueue (and queue it (with delay) if it is not)
    BUT it does NOT take into account the new delay (even if the new delay
    is earlier in time).
    schedule_delayed_work() returns 0 if it didn't queue the work,
    but we don't check the return code in __dst_free().
    
    If I understand the code in __dst_free() correctly, we want dst_gc_task
    to be queued after DST_GC_INC jiffies if we pass the test (and not in
    some undetermined time in the future), so I think we should add a call
    to cancel_delayed_work() before schedule_delayed_work(). Patch below.
    
    Or we should at least test the return code of schedule_delayed_work(),
    and reset the values of dst_garbage.timer_inc and dst_garbage.timer_expires
    back to their former values if schedule_delayed_work() failed.
    Otherwise the subsequent calls to __dst_free will test the wrong values
    and assume wrong thing about when the garbage collector is supposed to
    be scheduled.
    
    dst_gc_task() also calls schedule_delayed_work() without checking
    its return code (or calling cancel_scheduled_work() first), but it
    should fine there: dst_gc_task is the routine of the delayed_work, so
    no dst_gc_work should be pending in the queue when it's running.

       not for C code but for assembler routines.
    
    2) PAGE_EXEC isn't used, delete
    
    3) Several larger than 32-bit constants need "UL" markers

    This patch fixes a bug in Rate Scaling. When moving from SISO to MIMO we
    need to choose the lowest higher rate, instead of choosing the highest in MIMO.
    No doing this can lead to a high packet loss in the highest rate in MIMO,
    leading not to move MIMO although lower in MIMO could give a better TPT.

    mac80211: refactor and move scan RX code
    
    This patch refactors some code and moves the scan RX function
    to scan.c. More importantly, however, it changes it so that the
    MLME's beacon/probe_resp functions aren't invoked when scanning
    so that we can remove a "if (scanning)" conditions from two
    places.
    
    There's a very slight behavioural change in this patch: now,
    when scanning, IBSS and mesh aren't updated even on the same
    channel.

    mac80211: stop queues before carrier off
    
    During testing of the disassociation fixes, Tomas noticed that it
    was possible to run into a situation where you'd suddenly get a
    few "wlan0: dropped frame to <AP> (unauthorized port)" messages
    and I found this to be due to the AP's sta_info having been
    removed but netif_carrier_off not having removed/stopped traffic
    yet. To avoid that, stop the queue for the interface (and avoid
    bringing them up when another vif scans when they weren't up.)

    iwlwifi: use the results from disconnected antenna algorithm
    
    This patch makes usage of the results from disconnected antenna alg to
    know how many antennas are connected.
    
    It also synchronizes between the chain noise alg and the W/A that
    disables power management during association. All the antennas must be
    enables during the chain noise algorithm. Hence, power management is
    restored only after the completion of the algorithm.
    
    In the future, we will need to update the AP that we don't support MIMO
    if there is only one antenna connected. We also need to update the rate
    scaling algorithm.

    ipv6: On interface down/unregister, purge icmp routes too.
    
    Johannes Berg reported that occaisionally, bringing an interface
    down or unregistering it would hang for up to 30 seconds.  Using
    debugging output he provided it became clear that ICMP6 routes
    were the culprit.
    
    The problem is that ICMP6 routes live in their own world totally
    separate from normal ipv6 routes.  So there are all kinds of special
    cases throughout the ipv6 code to handle this.
    
    While we should really try to unify all of this stuff somehow,
    for the time being let's fix this by purging the ICMP6 routes
    that match the device in question during rt6_ifdown().

    x86: unsigned long pte_pfn
    
    pte_pfn() has always been of type unsigned long, even on 32-bit PAE;
    but in the current tip/next/mm tree it works out to be unsigned long
    long on 64-bit, which gives an irritating warning if you try to printk
    a pfn with the usual %lx.
    
    Now use the same pte_pfn() function, moved from pgtable-3level.h
    to pgtable.h, for all models: as suggested by Jeremy Fitzhardinge.
    And pte_page() can well move along with it (remaining a macro to
    avoid dependence on mm_types.h).

    ipsec: Use RCU-like construct for saved state within a walk
    
    Now that we save states within a walk we need synchronisation
    so that the list the saved state is on doesn't disappear from
    under us.
    
    As it stands this is done by keeping the state on the list which
    is bad because it gets in the way of the management of the state
    life-cycle.
    
    An alternative is to make our own pseudo-RCU system where we use
    counters to indicate which state can't be freed immediately as
    it may be referenced by an ongoing walk when that resumes.

    binutils, contrary to documented behaviour, will generate long NOPs (a

    Virtual PC/Virtual Server, and some versions of Qemu) depending on the
    -mtune= option, which is not supposed to change architectural

    Therefore, this second socket needs to be enabled, despite not being

    [ARM] Add -march=all to assembly file build in arch/arm/boot/compressed
    
    This allows assembly files to be crafted to cover all ARM CPU types
    rather than erroring out on instructions only in later CPUs.  We
    are careful in these files to only execute CPU specific code when
    the CPU ID says we can.

    bnx2x: EEH recovery fix
    
    When EEH detects an i/o error it resets the device thus it cannot be accessed.
    In this case the driver needs to unload its interface only with OS, kernel and
    network stack but not with the device.
    After successful recovery, the driver can load normally.

    - removed '#ifdef CONFIG_FIQ' from irqs.h
    - renamed imx_set_irq_type() to imx_set_irq_fiq()
    - made irqt unsigned

    The error handling in neo1973_init is incorrect:
    
    * If platform_device_add fails, we go on with the rest of the
      initialization instead of bailing out. Things will break when the
      module is removed (platform_device_unregister called on a device
      that wasn't registered.)
    
    * If i2c_add_driver fails, we return an error so the module will not
      load, but we don't unregister neo1973_snd_device, so we are leaking
      resources.
    
    Add the missing error handling.

    This helps automated tools like kerneloops.org to collect the data

    net: Enable TSO if supported by at least one device
    
    As it stands users of netdev_compute_features (e.g., bridges/bonding)
    will only enable TSO if all consituent devices support it.  This
    is unnecessarily pessimistic since even on devices that do not
    support hardware TSO and SG, emulated TSO still performs to a par
    with TSO off.
    
    This patch enables TSO if at least on constituent device supports
    it in hardware.
    
    The direct beneficiaries will be virtualisation that uses bridging
    since this means that TSO will always be enabled for communication
    from the host to the guests.

    iwlwifi: enable packet injection for iwlagn
    
    Handle station IDs of transmitted packets when in monitor mode, and
    remove the various anti-injection checks from the iwl4965 driver.
    This makes injection work on iwl4965 and iwl5000. Tested on both cards.
    
    Note: To inject management frames with encryption, HW crypto support
    must be disabled using the "swcrypto=1" modparam (or "swcrypto50=1"
    for iwl5000). Otherwise most management frames won't be transmitted.

    iwlwifi: allow association on radar channel in power save
    
    This patch disables power save upon association and enables it back
    after association. This allows to associate to AP on a radar channel
    if power save is enabled.
    
    Radar and passive channels are not allowed for TX (required for association)
    unless RX is received but PS may close the radio and no RX will be received
    effectively failing association.

    mac80211: Fix rate scale initialization in IBSS
    
    This patch address some IBSS rate issues introduced or not covered
    by "mac80211: eliminate IBSS warning in rate_lowest_index()" and
    "cfg80211 API for channels/bitrates, mac80211 and driver conversion".
    
    This patch:
    1. Moves addition of IBSS station from
    prepare_for_handlers to ieee80211_rx_bss_info when triggered from beacon
    eliminating bogus supported rates.
    2. Initialize properly supported rates also in IBSS merging
    3. Ensure that mandatory rates are always added into supported
    rates. This is needed in case when station addition is triggered from
    non beacon/probe packet. Some management frames need to be sent
    4. Remove initialization of supported rates from self rates. This path
    was dead code after 6bc37c06bc4 and in general incorrect.

    An IBSS station is added in prepare_for_handlers where the rate scaling was
    initialized only with single rate matching the received packet.
    The correct rate scale information should be updated only in
    ieee80211_rx_bss_info function where beacon is parsed. Because
    of coding error the rate info was left untouched.
    If a beacon has triggered the connection the rate remined 1Mbps.

    (or: LowerMAC Protocol Rev: 5.5 )
    
    And this is a big win, since:
     * newer firmwares are more stable and reliable than the old ones.
     * no problems anymore with packages > 1399 octets (without lowering the MTU).
     * monitor mode finally works on USB for more than just a few seconds.

    kernel/cpu.c: create a CPU_STARTING cpu_chain notifier
    
    Right now, there is no notifier that is called on a new cpu, before the new
    cpu begins processing interrupts/softirqs.
    Various kernel function would need that notification, e.g. kvm works around
    by calling smp_call_function_single(), rcu polls cpu_online_map.
    
    The patch adds a CPU_STARTING notification. It also adds a helper function
    that sends the message to all cpu_chain handlers.
    
    Tested on x86-64.
    All other archs are untested. Especially on sparc, I'm not sure if I got
    it right.

    Calculate the journal device name once and stash it away in the

    on-stack buffer.  In addition, we eliminate the '/' that can appear in
    device names (e.g. "cciss/c0d0p9" --- see kernel bugzilla #11321) that
    can cause problems when creating proc directory names, and include the
    inode number to support ocfs2 which creates multiple journals with

    basis is taken from bdevname, which, surprise, can contain slash.
    
    However, proc while allowing to use proc_create("a/b", parent) form of
    PDE creation, assumes that parent/a was already created.
    
    bdevname in question is 'cciss/c0d0p9', directory is not created and all
    this stuff goes directly into /proc (which is real bug).
    
    Warning comes when _second_ partition is mounted.

    ext4: Avoid printk floods in the face of directory corruption
    
    Note: some people thinks this represents a security bug, since it
    might make the system go away while it is printing a large number of
    console messages, especially if a serial console is involved.  Hence,
    it has been assigned CVE-2008-3528, but it requires that the attacker
    either has physical access to your machine to insert a USB disk with a
    corrupted filesystem image (at which point why not just hit the power
    button), or is otherwise able to convince the system administrator to
    mount an arbitrary filesystem image (at which point why not just
    include a setuid shell or world-writable hard disk device file or some
    such).  Me, I think they're just being silly. --tytso

    ext4: Properly update i_disksize.
    
    With delayed allocation we use i_data_sem to update i_disksize.  We need
    to update i_disksize only if the new size specified is greater than the
    current value and we need to make sure we don't race with other
    i_disksize update.  With delayed allocation we will switch to the
    write_begin function for non-delayed allocation if we are low on free
    blocks.  This means the write_begin function for non-delayed allocation
    also needs to use the same locking.
    
    We also need to check and update i_disksize even if the new size is less
    that inode.i_size because of delayed allocation.

    For blocksize < pagesize we need to remove blocks that got allocated in

    block_write_begin() internally does this if it allocated pages locally.

    ext4: Fix ext4 nomballoc allocator for ENOSPC
    
    We run into ENOSPC error on nonmballoc ext4, even when there is free blocks
    on the filesystem.
    
    The patch includes two changes:
    
    a) Set reservation to NULL if we trying to allocate near group_target_block
    from the goal group if the free block in the group is less than windows.
    This should give us a better chance to allocate near group_target_block.
    This also ensures that if we are not allocating near group_target_block
    then we don't trun off reservation. This should enable us to allocate
    with reservation from other groups that have large free blocks count.
    
    b) we don't need to check the window size if the block reservation is off.

    ext4: Switch to non delalloc mode when we are low on free blocks count.
    
    The delayed allocation code allocates blocks during writepages(), which
    can not handle block allocation failures.  To deal with this, we switch
    away from delayed allocation mode when we are running low on free

    of meta-data blocks in case all of the requested blocks are
    discontiguous.

    retry block reservation to handle temporary disk full conditions.  Also

    ext4: Make sure all the block allocation paths reserve blocks
    
    With delayed allocation we need to make sure block are reserved before
    we attempt to allocate them. Otherwise we get block allocation failure
    (ENOSPC) during writepages which cannot be handled. This would mean
    silent data loss (We do a printk stating data will be lost). This patch
    updates the DIO and fallocate code path to do block reservation before
    block allocation. This is needed to make sure parallel DIO and fallocate
    request doesn't take block out of delayed reserve space.
    
    When free blocks count go below a threshold we switch to a slow patch
    which looks at other CPU's accumulated percpu counter values.

    x86: dma_alloc_coherent sets gfp flags properly
    
    Non real IOMMU implemenations (which doesn't do virtual mappings,

    ia64: dma_alloc_coherent always use GFP_DMA
    
    This patch makes dma_alloc_coherent use GFP_DMA at all times. This is
    necessary for swiotlb, which requires the callers to set up the gfp
    flags properly.
    
    swiotlb_alloc_coherent tries to allocate pages with the gfp flags. If
    the allocated memory isn't fit for dev->coherent_dma_mask,
    swiotlb_alloc_coherent reserves some of the swiotlb memory area, which
    is precious resource. So the callers need to set up the gfp flags
    properly.
    
    This patch means that other IA64 IOMMUs' dma_alloc_coherent also use
    GFP_DMA. These IOMMUs (e.g. SBA IOMMU) don't need GFP_DMA since they
    can map a memory to any address. But IA64's GFP_DMA is large,
    generally drivers allocate small memory with dma_alloc_coherent only
    at startup. So I chose the simplest way to set up the gfp flags for
    swiotlb.

    x86: check for and defend against BIOS memory corruption
    
    Some BIOSes have been observed to corrupt memory in the low 64k.  This
    change:
     - Reserves all memory which does not have to be in that area, to
       prevent it from being used as general memory by the kernel.  Things
       like the SMP trampoline are still in the memory, however.
     - Clears the reserved memory so we can observe changes to it.
     - Adds a function check_for_bios_corruption() which checks and reports on
       memory becoming unexpectedly non-zero.  Currently it's called in the
       x86 fault handler, and the powermanagement debug output.

    Introduce HAVE_AOUT symbol to remove hard-coded arch list for BINFMT_AOUT
    
    HAVE_AOUT doesn't quite do the same thing as the recently removed

    binfmt_aout isn't supported, although it's not entirely clear why.
    
    So it's best just to introduce a new symbol, handled consistently with
    other similar HAVE_xxx symbols; with a simple 'select' in the arch Kconfig.

    kernel/cpu.c: Move the CPU_DYING notifiers
    
    When a cpu is taken offline, the CPU_DYING notifiers are called on the
    dying cpu. According to <linux/notifiers.h>, the cpu should be "not
    running any task, not handling interrupts, soon dead".
    
    For the current implementation, this is not true:
    - __cpu_disable can fail. If it fails, then the cpu will remain alive
      and happy.
    - At least on x86, __cpu_disable() briefly enables the local interrupts
      to handle any outstanding interrupts.
    
    What about moving CPU_DYING down a few lines, behind the __cpu_disable()
    line?
    There are only two CPU_DYING handlers in the kernel right now: one in
    kvm, one in the scheduler. Both should work with the patch applied
    [and: I'm not sure if either one handles a failing __cpu_disable()]
    
    The patch survives simple offlining a cpu. kvm untested due to lack
    of a test setup.

    sched: fix __load_balance_iterator() for cfq with only one task
    
    The __load_balance_iterator() returns a NULL when there's only one
    sched_entity which is a task. It is caused by the following code-path.
    
    	/* Skip over entities that are not tasks */
    	do {
    		se = list_entry(next, struct sched_entity, group_node);
    		next = next->next;
    	} while (next != &cfs_rq->tasks && !entity_is_task(se));
    
    	if (next == &cfs_rq->tasks)
    		return NULL;
    	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
          This will return NULL even when se is a task.
    
    As a side-effect, there was a regression in sched_mc behavior since 2.6.25,
    since iter_move_one_task() when it calls load_balance_start_fair(),
    would not get any tasks to move!
    
    Fix this by checking if the last entity was a task or not.

    toshiba_acpi: Add support for bluetooth toggling through rfkill (v8)
    
    There's been a patch floating around for toshiba_acpi that exports an ad-hoc
    /proc interface to toggle the bluetooth adapter in a large number of Toshiba
    laptops. I'm not sure if it's still relevant for the latest models, but it is
    still required for older models such as my Tecra M3.
    
    This change pulls in the low level Toshiba-specific code from the old patch and
    sets up an rfkill device and a polled input device to track the state of the
    hardware kill-switch.

    For good measure, disallow adding interfaces in all other

    when they add it.

    ath5k: HW code cleanup
    
     * No code changes...
    
     * Split hw.c to multiple files for better maintenance and add some documentation on each file
       code is going to grow soon (eeprom.c for example is going to get much stuff currently developed
       on ath_info) so it's better this way.
    
     * Rename following functions to maintain naming scheme:
    
         ah_setup_xtx_desc -> ah_setup_mrr_tx_desc
         (Because xtx doesn't say much, it's actually
         a multi-rate-retry tx descriptor)
    
         ath5k_hw_put_tx/rx_buf - > ath5k_hw_set_tx/rxdp
         ath5k_hw_get_tx/rx_buf -> ath5k_hw_get_tx/rxdp
         (We don't put any "buf" we set descriptor pointers on hw)
    
         ath5k_hw_tx_start -> ath5k_hw_start_tx_dma
         ath5k_hw_start_rx -> ath5k_hw_start_rx_dma
         ath5k_hw_stop_pcu_recv -> ath5k_hw_stop_rx_pcu
         (It's easier this way to identify them, we also
         have ath5k_hw_start_rx_pcu which completes the
         set)
    
         ath5k_hw_set_intr -> ath5k_hw_set_imr
         (As in get_isr we set imr here, not "intr")
    
      * Move ath5k_hw_setup_rx_desc on ah->ah_setup_rx_desc so we can
        include support for different rx descriptors in the future
    
      * Further cleanups so that checkpatch doesn't complain
        (only some > 80 col warnings for eeprom.h and reg.h as usual
        due to comments)
    
      Tested on 5211 and 5213 cards and works ok.

    BIOS though, since I've killed mine. I tested the DMI version, but not
    this one.

    x86: hpet: modify IXP400 quirk to enable interrupts
    
    The current quirk is incomplete. Some more chipset fiddling has to be
    done to enable HPET interrupts. This patch aims to do this. From my
    tests it seems to work faultlessly.
    
    But the official statement is that HPET is not supported on SB4X0.
    
    Users will still have to use hpet=force to enable it.
    
    Use it at your own risk.

    x86: additional defconfig updates
    
    Additional updates to the x86 defconfigs.  The goals are, as before:
    
    - Make them usable to testers, more so than distributors or end users,
      both of which are likely to have their own config already.
    - Keep 32 and 64 bits as similar as is practical.
    
    Changes:
    
    - Use a more generic CPU type (ppro and generic, respectively).
    - Bump number of CPUs to 64 (few if any NR_CPUS arrays left).
    - Enable PAT.
    - Enable OPTIMIZE_INLINE.
    - Enable microcode update support.
    - Build SMT scheduler support (in addition to MC).

    [ARM] omap: fix inappropriate casting in gpio.c
    
    gpio.c wilfully casts physical addresses to void __iomem * and then
    fixes them up at runtime using:
    
    	bank->base = IO_ADDRESS(bank->base);
    
    where accesses prior to this fixup are via omap_read/omap_write, and
    after are by __raw_read/__raw_write.  This doesn't lend itself to
    static checking, nor to easy understanding of the code.
    
    And so, OMAP_MPUIO_BASE gets to be the right type - integer like since
    it's a physical address, not a MMIO pointer.

    [ARM] omap: Fix IO_ADDRESS() macros
    
    OMAP1_IO_ADDRESS(), OMAP2_IO_ADDRESS() and IO_ADDRESS() returns cookies
    for use with __raw_{read|write}* for accessing registers.  Therefore,
    these macros should return (void __iomem *) cookies, not integer values.
    
    Doing this improves typechecking, and means we can find those places
    where, eg, DMA controllers are incorrectly given virtual addresses to
    DMA to, or physical addresses are thrown through a virtual to physical
    address translation.

    GFS2: Use an IS_ERR test rather than a NULL test
    
    In case of error, the function gfs2_inode_lookup returns an
    ERR pointer, but never returns a NULL pointer. So a NULL test that
    necessarily comes after an IS_ERR test should be deleted, and a NULL
    test that may come after a call to this function should be
    strengthened by an IS_ERR test.
    
    The semantic match that finds this problem is as follows:
    (http://www.emn.fr/x-info/coccinelle/)
    
    // <smpl>

    GFS2: Fix race relating to glock min-hold time
    
    In the case that a request for a glock arrives right after the
    grant reply has arrived, it sometimes means that the gl_tstamp
    field hasn't been updated recently enough. The net result is that
    the min-hold time for the glock is ignored. If this happens
    often enough, it leads to poor performance.
    
    This patch adds an additional test, so that if the reply pending
    bit is set on a glock, then it will select the maximum length of
    time for the min-hold time, rather than looking at gl_tstamp.

      816  arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common_64.c
      805  arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.c
    
    and the resulting common.c is 1197 lines long, so there's already
    424 lines of code eliminated in this phase of the unification.

    mv643xx_eth: transmit multiqueue support
    
    As all the infrastructure for multiple transmit queues already exists
    in the driver, this patch is entirely trivial.
    
    The individual transmit queues are still serialised by the driver's
    per-port private spinlock, but that will disappear (i.e. be replaced
    by the per-subqueue ->_xmit_lock) in a subsequent patch.

    mv643xx_eth: delete unused and uninteresting interrupt source mask bits
    
    Delete a couple of unused and uninteresting interrupt source mask bits:
    - The receive resource underrun interrupt sources are uninteresting
      because if we are in out-of-memory mode, we are already dealing with
      the issue, and we don't need the hardware to remind us again that we
      are out of memory.
    - The LINK and PHY interrupt sources can be coalesced into one define,
      since we always use them together.
    - The transmit resource underrun interrupt source can be disabled since
      we never activate the head descriptor of a paged skb until the
      fragments are all activated, so transmit underrun during a packet
      should never happen.
    - The INT_EXT_TX_0 define is never used.

    mv643xx_eth: remove force_phy_addr field
    
    Currently, there are two different fields in the
    mv643xx_eth_platform_data struct that together describe the PHY
    address -- one field (phy_addr) has the address of the PHY, but if
    that address is zero, a second field (force_phy_addr) needs to be
    set to distinguish the actual address zero from a zero due to not
    having filled in the PHY address explicitly (which should mean
    'use the default PHY address').
    
    If we are a bit smarter about the encoding of the phy_addr field,
    we can avoid the need for a second field -- this patch does that.

    x86: quick TSC calibration, improve
    
    - make sure the final TSC timestamp is reliable too
    
    Signed-off-by: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>

commit 6ac40ed0413ef4096720f966e11c7cdf259eee3f
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>
Date:   Thu Sep 4 10:41:22 2008 -0700

    x86: quick TSC calibration
    
    Introduce a fast TSC-calibration method on sane hardware.
    
    It only uses 17920 PIT timer ticks to calibrate the TSC, plus 256 ticks on
    each side to make sure the TSC values were very close to the tick, so the
    whole calibration takes 15ms. Yet, despite only takign 15ms,
    we can actually give pretty stringent guarantees of accuracy:
    
     - the code requires that we hit each 256-counter block at least 50 times,
       so the TSC error is basically at *MOST* just a few PIT cycles off in
       any direction. In practice, it's going to be about one microseconds
       off (which is how long it takes to read the counter)
    
     - so over 17920 PIT cycles, we can pretty much guarantee that the
       calibration error is less than one half of a percent.
    
    My testing bears this out: on my machine, the quick-calibration reports
    2934.085kHz, while the slow one reports 2933.415.
    
    Yes, the slower calibration is still more precise. For me, the slow
    calibration is stable to within about one hundreth of a percent, so it's
    (at a guess) roughly an order-and-a-half of magnitude more precise. The
    longer you wait, the more precise you can be.
    
    However, the nice thing about the fast TSC PIT synchronization is that
    it's pretty much _guaranteed_ to give that 0.5% precision, and fail
    gracefully (and very quickly) if it doesn't get it. And it really is
    fairly simple (even if there's a lot of _details_ there, and I didn't get
    all of those right ont he first try or even the second ;)

    x86: move mtrr cpu cap setting early in early_init_xxxx
    
    Krzysztof Helt found MTRR is not detected on k6-2
    
    root cause:
    	we moved mtrr_bp_init() early for mtrr trimming,
    and in early_detect we only read the CPU capability from cpuid,
    so some cpu doesn't have that bit in cpuid.
    
    So we need to add early_init_xxxx to preset those bit before mtrr_bp_init
    for those earlier cpus.
    
    this patch is for v2.6.27

    IO resources: add reserve_region_with_split()
    
    add reserve_region_with_split() to not lose e820 reserved entries if

    with test case by extend 0xe0000000 - 0xeffffff to 0xdd800000 -
    we get:

    		 e0000000-efffffff : reserved
    
    and in /proc/iomem we get:

    x86: capitalize function call interrupts consistently
    
    Impact: aestetic
    
    Capitalize function call interrupts consistently.
    
    All other descriptions in /proc/interrupts are capitalized except
    for "function call interrupts". Capitalize it too for consistency.
    
    While that's technically a published ABI I think the risk of anyone
    relying on that text to stay the same is negligible.

    x86: TSC make the calibration loop smarter
    
    The last changes made the calibration loop 250ms long which is far
    too much. Try to do that more clever.
    
    Experiments have shown that using a 10ms delay for the PIT based calibration
    gives us a good enough value. If we have a reference (HPET/PMTIMER) and the
    result of the PIT and the reference is close enough, then we can break out of
    the calibration loop on a match right away and use the reference value.
    
    Otherwise we just loop 3 times and decide then, which value to take.
    
    One caveat is that for virtualized environments the PIT calibration often does
    not work at all and I found out that 10us is a bit too short as well for the
    reference to give a sane result. The solution here is to make the last loop
    longer when the first two PIT calibrations failed.

    The Kbuild variable "targets" is supposed to be

    Therefore, move all manipulation of "targets" as well as custom rules

    things that are genuinely configuration-dependent.

    dccp ccid-3: Preventing Oscillations
    
    This implements [RFC 3448, 4.5], which performs congestion avoidance behaviour
    by reducing the transmit rate as the queueing delay (measured in terms of
    long-term RTT) increases.
    
    Oscillation can be turned on/off via a module option (do_osc_prev) and via sysfs
    (using mode 0644), the default is off.
    
    Overflow analysis:
    ------------------
     * oscillation prevention is done after update_x(), so that t_ipi <= 64000;
     * hence the multiplication "t_ipi * sqrt(R_sample)" needs 64 bits;
     * done using u64 for sqrt_sample and explicit typecast of t_ipi;
     * the divisor, R_sqmean, is non-zero because oscillation prevention is first
       called when receiving the second feedback packet, and tfrc_scaled_rtt() > 0.
    
    A detailed discussion of the algorithm (with plots) is on
    http://www.erg.abdn.ac.uk/users/gerrit/dccp/notes/ccid3/sender_notes/oscillation_prevention/
    
    The algorithm has negative side effects:
      * when allowing to decrease t_ipi (leads to a large RTT) and
      * when using it during slow-start;
    both uses are therefore disabled.

    dccp ccid-3: Simplify computing and range-checking of t_ipi
    
    This patch simplifies the computation of t_ipi, avoiding expensive computations
    to enforce the minimum sending rate.
    
    Both RFC 3448 and rfc3448bis (revision #06), as well as RFC 4342 sec 5., require
    at various stages that at least one packet must be sent per t_mbi = 64 seconds.
    This requires frequent divisions of the type X_min = s/t_mbi, which are later
    converted back into an inter-packet-interval t_ipi_max = s/X_min = t_mbi.
    
    The patch removes the expensive indirection; in the unlikely case of having
    a sending rate less than one packet per 64 seconds, it also re-adjusts X.
    
    The following cases document conformance with RFC 3448  / rfc3448bis-06:
     1) Time until receiving the first feedback packet:
       * if the sender has no initial RTT sample then X = s/1 Bps > s/t_mbi;
       * if the sender has an initial RTT sample or when the first feedback
         packet is received, X = W_init/R > s/t_mbi.
    
     2) Slow-start (p == 0 and feedback packets come in):
       * RFC 3448  (current code) enforces a minimum of s/R > s/t_mbi;
       * rfc3448bis (future code) enforces an even higher minimum of W_init/R.
    
     3) Congestion avoidance with no absence of feedback (p > 0):
       * when X_calc or X_recv/2 are too low, the minimum of X_min = s/t_mbi
         is enforced in update_x() when calling update_send_interval();
       * update_send_interval() is, as before, only called when X changes
         (i.e. either when increasing or decreasing, not when in equilibrium).
    
     4) Reduction of X without prior feedback or during slow-start (p==0):
       * both RFC 3448 and rfc3448bis here halve X directly;
       * the associated constraint X >= s/t_mbi is nforced here by send_interval().
    
     5) Reduction of X when p > 0:
       * X is modified indirectly via X_recv (RFC 3448) or X_recv_set (rfc3448bis);
       * in both cases, control goes back to section 4.3 (in both documents);
       * since p > 0, both documents use X = max(min(...), s/t_mbi), which is
         enforced in this patch by calling send_interval() from update_x().
    
    I think that this analysis is exhaustive. Should I have forgotten a case,
    the worst-case consideration arises when X sinks below s/t_mbi, and is then
    increased back up to this minimum value. Even under this assumption, the
    behaviour is correct, since all lower limits of X in RFC 3448 / rfc3448bis
    are either equal to or greater than s/t_mbi.
    
    Note on the condition X >= s/t_mbi  <==> t_ipi = s/X <= t_mbi: since X is
    scaled by 64, and all time units are in microseconds, the coded condition is:
    
        t_ipi = s * 64 * 10^6 usec / X <= 64 * 10^6 usec
    
    This simplifies to s / X <= 1 second <==> X * 1 second >= s > 0.
    (A zero `s' is not allowed by the CCID-3 code).

    dccp ccid-3: Measuring the packet size s with regard to rfc3448bis-06
    
    rfc3448bis allows three different ways of tracking the packet size `s':
    
     1. using the MSS/MPS (at initialisation, 4.2, and in 4.1 (1));
     2. using the average of `s' (in 4.1);
     3. using the maximum of `s' (in 4.2).
    
    Instead of hard-coding a single interpretation of rfc3448bis, this implements
    a choice of all three alternatives and suggests the first as default, since it
    is the option which is most consistent with other parts of the specification.
    
    The patch further deprecates the update of t_ipi whenever `s' changes. The
    gains of doing this are only small since a change of s takes effect at the
    next instant X is updated:
     * when the next feedback comes in (within one RTT or less);
     * when the nofeedback timer expires (within at most 4 RTTs).
    
    Further, there are complications caused by updating t_ipi whenever s changes:
     * if t_ipi had previously been updated to effect oscillation prevention (4.5),
       then it is impossible to make the same adjustment to t_ipi again, thus
       counter-acting the algorithm;
     * s may be updated any time and a modification of t_ipi depends on the current
       state (e.g. no oscillation prevention is done in the absence of feedback);
     * in rev-06 of rfc3448bis, there are more possible cases, depending on whether
       the sender is in slow-start (t_ipi <= R/W_init), or in congestion-avoidance,
       limited by X_recv or the throughput equation (t_ipi <= t_mbi).
    
    Thus there are side effects of always updating t_ipi as s changes. These may not
    be desirable. The only case I can think of where such an update makes sense is
    to recompute X_calc when p > 0 and when s changes (not done by this patch).

    dccp ccid-3: Implement rfc3448bis change to initial-rate computation
    
    The patch updates CCID-3 with regard to the latest rfc3448bis-06:
     * in the first revisions of the draft, MSS was used for the RFC 3390 window;
     * then (from revision #1 to revision #2), it used the packet size `s';
     * now, in this revision (and apparently final), the value is back to MSS.
    
    This change has an implication for the case when no RTT sample is available,
    at the time of sending the first packet:
    
     * with RTT sample, 2*MSS/RTT <= initial_rate <= 4*MSS/RTT;
     * without RTT sample, the initial rate is one packet (s bytes) per second
       (sec. 4.2), but using s instead of MSS here creates an imbalance, since
       this would further reduce the initial sending rate.
    
    Hence the patch uses MSS (called MPS in RFC 4340) in all places.

    dccp ccid-3: Update the RX history records in one place
    
    This patch is a requirement for enabling ECN support later on. With that change
    in mind, the following preparations are done:
     * renamed handle_loss() into congestion_event() since it returns true when a
       congestion event happens (it will eventually also take care of ECN packets);
     * lets tfrc_rx_congestion_event() always update the RX history records, since
       this routine needs to be called for each non-duplicate packet anyway;
     * made all involved boolean-type functions to have return type `bool';
    
    Updating the RX history records is now only necessary for the packets received
    up to sending the first feedback. The receiver code becomes again simpler.

    dccp tfrc: Increase number of RTT samples
    
    This improves the receiver RTT sampling algorithm so that it tries harder to get
    as many RTT samples as possible.
    
    The algorithm is based the concepts presented in RFC 4340, 8.1, using timestamps
    and the CCVal window counter. There exist 4 cases for the CCVal difference:
     * == 0: less than RTT/4 passed since last packet -- unusable;
     *  > 4: (much) more than 1 RTT has passed since last packet -- also unusable;
     * == 4: perfect sample (exactly one RTT has passed since last packet);
     * 1..3: sub-optimal sample (between RTT/4 and 3*RTT/4 has passed).
    
    In the last case the algorithm tried to optimise by storing away the candidate
    and then re-trying next time. The problem is that
     * a large number of samples is needed to smooth out the inaccuracies of the
       algorithm;
     * the sender may not be sending enough packets to warrant a "next time";
     * hence it is better to use suboptimal samples whenever possible.
    The algorithm now stores away the current sample only if the difference is 0.
    
    Applicability and background
    ----------------------------
    A realistic example is MP3 streaming where packets are sent at a rate of less
    than one packet per RTT, which means that suitable samples are absent for a
    very long time.
    
    The effectiveness of using suboptimal samples (with a delta between 1 and 4) was
    confirmed by instrumenting the algorithm with counters. The results of two 20
    second test runs were:
     * With the old algorithm and a total of 38442 function calls, only 394 of these
       calls resulted in usable RTT samples (about 1%), and 378 out of these were
       "perfect" samples and 28013 (unused) samples had a delta of 1..3.
     * With the new algorithm and a total of 37057 function calls, 1702 usable RTT
       samples were retrieved (about 4.6%), 5 out of these were "perfect" samples.

    This updates the CCID-3 receiver in part with regard to errata 610 and 611

    RTT (or use a sender RTT).
    
    Doing this requires reusing the RX history structure after dealing with a loss.
    
    The patch does not resolve how to compute X_recv if the interval is less
    than 1 RTT. A FIXME has been added (and is resolved in subsequent patch).
    
    Furthermore, since this is all TFRC-based functionality, the RTT estimation
    is now also performed by the dccp_tfrc_lib module. This further simplifies

    		return 0;
    
    which means that update_i_mean can only increase the length of the open loss
    interval I_0, and hence the value of I_tot0 (RFC 3448, 5.4). Consequently the
    test `i_mean < old_i_mean' at the end of the function always evaluates to false.
    
    There is no known way by which a loss interval can suddenly become shorter,
    therefore the return type of the function is changed to void. (That is, under
    the given circumstances step (3) in RFC 3448, 6.1 will not occur.)
    
    Further changes:
    ----------------
     * the function is now called from tfrc_rx_handle_loss, which is equivalent
       to the previous way of calling from rx_packet_recv (it was called whenever
       there was no new or pending loss, now  it is also updated when there is
       a pending loss - this increases the accuracy a bit);
     * added a FIXME to possibly consider NDP counting as per RFC 4342 (this is
       not implemented yet).

    dccp tfrc: Perform early loss detection
    
    This enables the TFRC code to begin loss detection (as soon as the module
    is loaded), using the latest updates from rfc3448bis-06, 6.3.1:
    
     * when the first data packet(s) are lost or marked, set
     * X_target = s/(2*R) => f(p) = s/(R * X_target) = 2,
     * corresponding to a loss rate of ~ 20.64%.
    
    The handle_loss() function is now called right at the begin of rx_packet_recv()
    and thus no longer protected against duplicates: hence a call to rx_duplicate()
    has been added.  Such a call makes sense now, as the previous patch initialises
    the first entry with a sequence number of GSR.

    dccp tfrc: Suppress unavoidable "below resolution" warning
    
    In the congestion-avoidance phase a decay of p towards 0 is natural once fewer
    losses are encountered. Hence the warning message "p is below resolution" is
    not necessary, and thus turned into a debug message by this patch.
    
    The TFRC_SMALLEST_P is needed since in theory p never actually reaches 0. When
    no further losses are encountered, the loss interval I_0 grows in length,
    causing p to decrease towards 0, causing X_calc = s/(RTT * f(p)) to increase.
    
    With the given minimum-resolution this congestion avoidance phase stops at some
    fixed value, an approximation formula has been added to the documentation.

    dccp ccid-3: Simplified handling of TX states
    
    Since CCIDs are only used during the established phase of a connection,
    they have very little internal state; this specifically reduces to:
    
     * "no packet sent" if and only if s == 0, for the TX packet size s;
    
     * when the first packet has been sent (i.e. `s' > 0), the question is whether
       or not feedback has been received:
       - if a feedback packet is received, "feedback = yes" is set,
       - if the nofeedback timer expires,  "feedback = no"  is set.
    
    Thus the CCID only needs to remember state about whether or not feedback
    has been received. This is now implemented using a boolean flag, which is
    toggled when a feedback packet arrives or the nofeedback timer expires.

    dccp ccid-3: Runtime verification of timer resolution
    
    The DCCP base time resolution is 10 microseconds (RFC 4340, 13.1 ... 13.3).
    
    Using a timer with a lower resolution was found to trigger the following
    bug warnings/problems on high-speed networks (e.g. local loopback):
     * RTT samples are rounded down to 0 if below resolution;
     * in some cases, negative RTT samples were observed;
     * the CCID-3 feedback timer complains that the feedback interval is 0,
       since the feedback interval is in the order of 1 RTT or less and RTT
       measurement rounded this down to 0;
    On an Intel computer this will for instance happen when using a
    boot-time parameter of "clocksource=jiffies".
    
    The following system log messages were observed:
      11:24:00 kernel: BUG: delta (0) <= 0 at ccid3_hc_rx_send_feedback()
      11:26:12 kernel: BUG: delta (0) <= 0 at ccid3_hc_rx_send_feedback()
      11:26:30 kernel: dccp_sample_rtt: unusable RTT sample 0, using min
      11:26:30 last message repeated 5 times
    
    This patch defines a global constant for the time resolution, adds this in
    timer.c, and checks the available clock resolution at CCID-3 module load time.
    
    When the resolution is worse than 10 microseconds, module loading exits with
    a message "socket type not supported".

    dccp: Policy-based packet dequeueing infrastructure
    
    This patch adds a generic infrastructure for policy-based dequeueing of
    TX packets and provides two policies:
     * a simple FIFO policy (which is the default) and
     * a priority based policy (set via socket options).
    Both policies honour the tx_qlen sysctl for the maximum size of the write
    queue (can be overridden via socket options).
    
    The priority policy uses skb->priority internally to assign an u32 priority
    identifier, using the same ranking as SO_PRIORITY. The skb->priority field
    is set to 0 when the packet leaves DCCP. The priority is supplied as ancillary
    data using cmsg(3), the patch also provides the requisite parsing routines.

    dccp: Clean up slow-path input processing
    
    This patch rearranges the order of statements of the slow-path input processing
    (i.e. any other state than OPEN), to resolve the following issues.
    
     1. Dependencies: the order of statements now better matches RFC 4340, 8.5, i.e.
        step 7 is before step 9 (previously 9 was before 7), and parsing options in
        step 8 (which can consume resources) now comes after step 7.
     2. Bug-fix: in state CLOSED, there should not be any sequence number checking
        or option processing. This is why the test for CLOSED has been moved after
        the test for LISTEN.
     3. As before sequence number checks are omitted if in state LISTEN/REQUEST, due
        to the note underneath the table in RFC 4340, 7.5.3.
     4. Packets are now passed on to Ack Vector / CCID processing only after
        - step 7  (receive unexpected packets),
        - step 9  (receive Reset),
        - step 13 (receive CloseReq),
        - step 14 (receive Close)
        and only if the state is PARTOPEN. This simplifies CCID processing:
        - in LISTEN/CLOSED the CCIDs are non-existent;
        - in RESPOND/REQUEST the CCIDs have not yet been negotiated;
        - in CLOSEREQ and active-CLOSING the node has already closed this socket;
        - in passive-CLOSING the client is waiting for its Reset.
        In the last case, RFC 4340, 8.3 leaves it open to ignore further incoming
        data, which is the approach taken here.
    
    As a result of (3), CCID processing is now indeed confined to OPEN/PARTOPEN
    states, i.e. congestion control is performed only on the flow of data packets.
    
    This avoids pathological cases of doing congestion control on those messages
    which set up and terminate the connection.
    
    I have done a few checks to see if this creates a problem in other parts of
    the code. This seems not to be the case; even if there were one, it would be
    better to fix it than to perform congestion control on Close/Request/Response
    messages. Similarly for Ack Vectors (as they depend on the negotiated CCID).

     * in tx_packet_sent only if !timer_pending() (BUG_ON is redundant here);
     * previously in new_ack, after stopping the timer (timer_pending() false).
    
    One further motive behind this patch is to replace the RTO timer with the

    dccp ccid-2: Replace broken RTT estimator with better algorithm
    
    The current CCID-2 RTT estimator code is in parts broken and lags behind the
    suggestions in RFC2988 of using scaled variants for SRTT/RTTVAR.
    That code is replaced by the present patch, which reuses the Linux TCP RTT
    estimator code - reasons for this code duplication are given below.
    
    Further details:
    ----------------
     1. The minimum RTO of previously one second has been replaced with TCP's, since
        RFC4341, sec. 5 says that the minimum of 1 sec. (suggested in RFC2988, 2.4)
        is not necessary. Instead, the TCP_RTO_MIN is used, which agrees with DCCP's
        concept of a default RTT (RFC 4340, 3.4).
     2. The maximum RTO has been set to DCCP_RTO_MAX (64 sec), which agrees with
        RFC2988, (2.5).
     3. De-inlined the function ccid2_new_ack().
     4. Added a FIXME: the RTT is sampled several times per Ack Vector, which will
        give the wrong estimate. It should be replaced with one sample per Ack.
        However, at the moment this can not be resolved easily, since
        - it depends on TX history code (which also needs some work),
        - the cleanest solution is not to use the `sent' time at all (saves 4 bytes
          per entry) and use DCCP timestamps / elapsed time to estimated the RTT,
          which however is non-trivial to get right (but needs to be done).
    
    Reasons for reusing the Linux TCP estimator algorithm:
    ------------------------------------------------------
    Some time was spent to find a better alternative, using basic RFC2988 as a first
    step. Further analysis and experimentation showed that the Linux TCP RTO
    estimator is superior to a basic RFC2988 implementation. A summary is on
    http://www.erg.abdn.ac.uk/users/gerrit/dccp/notes/ccid2/rto_estimator/
    
    In addition, this estimator fared well in a recent empirical evaluation:
    
        Rewaskar, Sushant, Jasleen Kaur and F. Donelson Smith.

        Implementations. Proceedings of 15th IEEE International
        Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP-07). 2007.
    
    Thus there is significant benefit in reusing the existing TCP code.

    dccp ccid-2: Simplify dec_pipe and rearming of RTO timer
    
    This removes the dec_pipe function and improves the way the RTO timer is rearmed
    when a new acknowledgment comes in.
    
    Details and justification for removal:
    --------------------------------------
     1) The BUG_ON in dec_pipe is never triggered: pipe is only decremented for TX
        history entries between tail and head, for which it had previously been
        incremented in tx_packet_sent; and it is not decremented twice for the same
        entry, since it is
        - either decremented when a corresponding Ack Vector cell in state 0 or 1
          was received (and then ccid2s_acked==1),
        - or it is decremented when ccid2s_acked==0, as part of the loss detection
          in tx_packet_recv (and hence it can not have been decremented earlier).
    
     2) Restarting the RTO timer happens for every single entry in each Ack Vector
        parsed by tx_packet_recv (according to RFC 4340, 11.4 this can happen up to
        16192 times per Ack Vector).
    
     3) The RTO timer should not be restarted when all outstanding data has been
        acknowledged. This is currently done similar to (2), in dec_pipe, when
        pipe has reached 0.
    
    The patch onsolidates the code which rearms the RTO timer, combining the
    segments from new_ack and dec_pipe. As a result, the code becomes clearer
    (compare with tcp_rearm_rto()).

    dccp ccid-2: Remove redundant sanity tests
    
    This removes the ccid2_hc_tx_check_sanity function: it is redundant.
    
    Details:
    ========
    The tx_check_sanity function performs three tests:
     1) it checks that the circular TX list is sorted
        - in ascending order of sequence number (ccid2s_seq)
        - and time (ccid2s_sent),
        - in the direction from `tail' (hctx_seqt) to `head' (hctx_seqh);
     2) it ensures that the entire list has the length seqbufc * CCID2_SEQBUF_LEN;
     3) it ensures that pipe equals the number of packets that were not
        marked `acked' (ccid2s_acked) between `tail' and `head'.
    
    The following argues that each of these tests is redundant, this can be verified
    by going through the code.
    
    (1) is not necessary, since both time and GSS increase from one packet to the
    next, so that subsequent insertions in tx_packet_sent (which advance the `head'
    pointer) will be in ascending order of time and sequence number.
    
    In (2), the length of the list is always equal to seqbufc times CCID2_SEQBUF_LEN
    (set to 1024) unless allocation caused an earlier failure, because:
     * at initialisation (tx_init), there is one chunk of size 1024 and seqbufc=1;
     * subsequent calls to tx_alloc_seq take place whenever head->next == tail in
       tx_packet_sent; then a new chunk of size 1024 is inserted between head and
       tail, and seqbufc is incremented by one.
    
    To show that (3) is redundant requires looking at two cases.
    
    The `pipe' variable of the TX socket is incremented only in tx_packet_sent, and
    decremented in tx_packet_recv.  When head == tail (TX history empty) then pipe
    should be 0, which is the case directly after initialisation and after a
    retransmission timeout has occurred (ccid2_hc_tx_rto_expire).
    
    The first case involves parsing Ack Vectors for packets recorded in the live
    portion of the buffer, between tail and head. For each packet marked by the
    receiver as received (state 0) or ECN-marked (state 1), pipe is decremented by
    one, so for all such packets the BUG_ON in tx_check_sanity will not trigger.
    
    The second case is the loss detection in the second half of tx_packet_recv,
    below the comment "Check for NUMDUPACK".
    
    The first while-loop here ensures that the sequence number of `seqp' is either
    above or equal to `high_ack', or otherwise equal to the highest sequence number
    sent so far (of the entry head->prev, as head points to the next unsent entry).
    The next while-loop ("while (1)") counts the number of acked packets starting
    from that position of seqp, going backwards in the direction from head->prev to
    tail. If NUMDUPACK=3 such packets were counted within this loop, `seqp' points
    to the last acknowledged packet of these, and the "if (done == NUMDUPACK)" block
    is entered next.
    The while-loop contained within that block in turn traverses the list backwards,
    from head to tail; the position of `seqp' is saved in the variable `last_acked'.
    For each packet not marked as `acked', a congestion event is triggered within
    the loop, and pipe is decremented. The loop terminates when `seqp' has reached
    `tail', whereupon tail is set to the position previously stored in `last_acked'.
    Thus, between `last_acked' and the previous position of `tail',
     - pipe has been decremented earlier if the packet was marked as state 0 or 1;
     - pipe was decremented if the packet was not marked as acked.
    That is, pipe has been decremented by the number of packets between `last_acked'
    and the previous position of `tail'. As a consequence, pipe now again reflects
    the number of packets which have not (yet) been acked between the new position
    of tail (at `last_acked') and head->prev, or 0 if head==tail. The result is that
    the BUG_ON condition in check_sanity will also not be triggered, hence the test
    (3) is also redundant.

     * the delay suggested by the CCID exceeds the time budget;
     * a socket error occurred while waiting for the CCID;
     * there is a signal pending (eg. annoyed user pressed Control-C);
     * the CCID does not support delays (we don't know how long it will take).

    will enqueue up to net.dccp.default.tx_qlen packets (default=5), without waiting
    for them to be released to the network.
    
    Rate-based CCIDs, such as CCID3/4, can impose sending delays of up to maximally
    64 seconds (t_mbi in RFC 3448). Hence the write queue may still contain packets
    when the application closes. Since the write queue is congestion-controlled by
    the CCID, draining the queue is also under control of the CCID.
    
    There are several problems that needed to be addressed:
     1) The queue-drain mechanism only works with rate-based CCIDs. If CCID2 for
        example has a full TX queue and becomes network-limited just as the
        application wants to close, then waiting for CCID2 to become unblocked could
        lead to an indefinite  delay (i.e., application "hangs").
     2) Since each TX CCID in turn uses a feedback mechanism, there may be changes
        in its sending policy while the queue is being drained. This can lead to
        further delays during which the application will not be able to terminate.
     3) The minimum wait time for CCID3/4 can be expected to be the queue length
        times the current inter-packet delay. For example if tx_qlen=100 and a delay
        of 15 ms is used for each packet, then the application would have to wait
        for a minimum of 1.5 seconds before being allowed to exit.
     4) There is no way for the user/application to control this behaviour. It would
        be good to use the timeout argument of dccp_close() as an upper bound. Then
        the maximum time that an application is willing to wait for its CCIDs to can
        be set via the SO_LINGER option.
    
    These problems are addressed by giving the CCID a grace period of up to the
    `timeout' value.
    
    The wait-for-ccid function is, as before, used when the application
     (a) has read all the data in its receive buffer and
     (b) if SO_LINGER was set with a non-zero linger time, or
     (c) the socket is either in the OPEN (active close) or in the PASSIVE_CLOSEREQ
         state (client application closes after receiving CloseReq).
    
    In addition, there is a catch-all case by calling __skb_queue_purge() after
    waiting for the CCID. This is necessary since the write queue may still have
    data when
     (a) the host has been passively-closed,
     (b) abnormal termination (unread data, zero linger time),
     (c) wait-for-ccid could not finish within the given time limit.

    dccp: Extend CCID packet dequeueing interface
    
    This extends the packet dequeuing interface of dccp_write_xmit() to allow
     1. CCIDs to take care of timing when the next packet may be sent;
     2. delayed sending (as before, with an inter-packet gap up to 65.535 seconds).
    
    The main purpose is to take CCID2 out of its polling mode (when it is network-
    limited, it tries every millisecond to send, without interruption).
    The interface can also be used to support other CCIDs.
    
    The mode of operation for (2) is as follows:
     * new packet is enqueued via dccp_sendmsg() => dccp_write_xmit(),
     * ccid_hc_tx_send_packet() detects that it may not send (e.g. window full),
     * it signals this condition via `CCID_PACKET_WILL_DEQUEUE_LATER',
     * dccp_write_xmit() returns without further action;
     * after some time the wait-condition for CCID becomes true,
     * that CCID schedules the tasklet,
     * tasklet function calls ccid_hc_tx_send_packet() via dccp_write_xmit(),
     * since the wait-condition is now true, ccid_hc_tx_packet() returns "send now",
     * packet is sent, and possibly more (since dccp_write_xmit() loops).
    
    Code reuse: the taskled function calls dccp_write_xmit(), the timer function
                reduces to a wrapper around the same code.
    
    If the tasklet finds that the socket is locked, it re-schedules the tasklet
    function (not the tasklet) after one jiffy.
    
    Changed DCCP_BUG to dccp_pr_debug when transmit_skb returns an error (e.g. when a
    local qdisc is used, NET_XMIT_DROP=1 can be returned for many packets).

    dccp: Return-value convention of hc_tx_send_packet()
    
    This patch reorganises the return value convention of the CCID TX sending
    function, to permit more flexible schemes, as required by subsequent patches.
    
    Currently the convention is
     * values < 0     mean error,
     * a value == 0   means "send now", and
     * a value x > 0  means "send in x milliseconds".
    
    The patch provides symbolic constants and a function to interpret return values.
    In addition, it caps the maximum positive return value to 0xFFFF milliseconds,
    corresponding to 65.535 seconds.
    
    This is possible since in CCID-3 the maximum inter-packet gap is t_mbi = 64 sec.

    dccp ccid-2: Separate option parsing from CCID processing
    
    This patch replaces an almost identical replication of code: large parts
    of dccp_parse_options() re-appeared as ccid2_ackvector() in ccid2.c.
    
    Apart from the duplication, this caused two more problems:
     1. CCIDs should not need to be concerned with parsing header options;
     2. one can not assume that Ack Vectors appear as a contiguous area within an
        skb, it is legal to insert other options and/or padding in between. The
        current code would throw an error and stop reading in such a case.
    
    The patch provides a new data structure and associated list housekeeping.
    
    Only small changes were necessary to integrate with CCID-2: data structure
    initialisation, adapt list traversal routine, and add call to the provided
    cleanup routine.
    
    The latter also lead to fixing the following BUG: CCID-2 so far ignored
    Ack Vectors on all packets other than Ack/DataAck, which is incorrect,
    since Ack Vectors can be present on any packet that has an Ack field.
    
    Details:
    --------
     * received Ack Vectors are parsed by dccp_parse_options() alone, which passes
       the result on to the CCID-specific routine ccid_hc_tx_parse_options();
     * CCIDs interested in using/decoding Ack Vector information will add code
       to fetch parsed Ack Vectors via this interface;
     * a data structure, `struct dccp_ackvec_parsed' is provided as interface;
     * this structure arranges Ack Vectors of the same skb into a FIFO order;
     * a doubly-linked list is used to keep the required FIFO code small.

    dccp ccid-2: Remove old infrastructure
    
    This removes
     * functions for which updates have been provided in the preceding patches and
     * the @av_vec_len field - it is no longer necessary since the buffer length is
       now always computed dynamically;
     * conditional debugging code (CONFIG_IP_DCCP_ACKVEC).
    
    The reason for removing the conditional debugging code is that Ack Vectors are
    an almost inevitable necessity - RFC 4341 says that for CCID-2, Ack Vectors must
    be used. Furthermore, the code would be only interesting for coding - after some
    extensive testing with this patch set, having the debug code around is no longer
    of real help.

    dccp ccid-2: Schedule Sync as out-of-band mechanism
    
    The problem with Ack Vectors is that
    
      i) their length is variable and can in principle grow quite large,
     ii) it is hard to predict exactly how large they will be.
    
    Due to the second point it seems not a good idea to reduce the MPS; in
    particular when on average there is enough room for the Ack Vector and an
    increase in length is momentarily due to some burst loss, after which the
    Ack Vector returns to its normal/average length.
    
    The solution taken by this patch is to subtract a minimum-expected Ack Vector
    length from the MPS (previous patch), and to defer any larger Ack Vectors onto
    a separate Sync - but only if indeed there is no space left on the skb.
    
    This patch provides the infrastructure to schedule Sync-packets for transporting
    (urgent) out-of-band data. Its signalling is quicker than scheduling an Ack, since
    it does not need to wait for new application data.
    
    It can thus serve other parts of the DCCP code as well.

    dccp ccid-2: Update code for the Ack Vector input/registration routine
    
    This patch uupdates the code which registers new packets as received, using the
    new circular buffer interface. It contributes a new algorithm which
    	* supports both tail/head pointers and buffer wrap-around and
    	* deals with overflow (head/tail move in lock-step).
    
    The updated code is also partioned differently, into
    	1. dealing with the empty buffer,
    	2. adding new packets into non-empty buffer,
    	3. reserving space when encountering a `hole' in the sequence space,
    	4. updating old state and deciding when old state is irrelevant.
    
    Protection against large burst losses: With regard to (3), it is too costly to
    reserve space when there are large bursts of losses. When bursts get too large,
    the code does no longer reserve space and just fills in cells normally. This
    measure reduces space consumption by a factor of 63.
    
    The code reuses in part the previous implementation by Arnaldo de Melo.

    dccp ccid-2: Algorithm to update buffer state
    
    This provides a routine to consistently update the buffer state when the
    peer acknowledges receipt of Ack Vectors; updating state in the list of Ack
    Vectors as well as in the circular buffer.
    
    While based on RFC 4340, several additional (and necessary) precautions were
    added to protect the consistency of the buffer state. These additions are
    essential, since analysis and experience showed that the basic algorithm was
    insufficient for this task (which lead to problems that were hard to debug).
    
    The algorithm now
     * deals with HC-sender acknowledging to HC-receiver and vice versa,
     * keeps track of the last unacknowledged but received seqno in tail_ackno,
     * has special cases to reset the overflow condition when appropriate,
     * is protected against receiving older information (would mess up buffer state).
    
    Note: The older code performed an unnecessary step, where the sender cleared
    Ack Vector state by parsing the Ack Vector received by the HC-receiver. Doing
    this was entirely redundant, since
     * the receiver always puts the full acknowledgment window (groups 2,3 in 11.4.2)
       into the Ack Vectors it sends; hence the HC-receiver is only interested in the
       highest state that the HC-sender received;
     * this means that the acknowledgment number on the (Data)Ack from the HC-sender
       is sufficient; and work done in parsing earlier state is not necessary, since
       the later state subsumes the  earlier one (see also RFC 4340, A.4).
    This older interface (dccp_ackvec_parse()) is therefore removed.

    dccp ccid-2: Implementation of circular Ack Vector buffer with overflow handling
    
    This completes the implementation of a circular buffer for Ack Vectors, by
    extending the current (linear array-based) implementation.  The changes are:
    
     (a) An `overflow' flag to deal with the case of overflow. As before, dynamic
         growth of the buffer will not be supported; but code will be added to deal
         robustly with overflowing Ack Vector buffers.
    
     (b) A `tail_seqno' field. When naively implementing the algorithm of Appendix A
         in RFC 4340, problems arise whenever subsequent Ack Vector records overlap,
         which can bring the entire run length calculation completely out of synch.
         (This is documented on http://www.erg.abdn.ac.uk/users/gerrit/dccp/notes/\
                                                 ack_vectors/tracking_tail_ackno/ .)
     (c) The buffer lengthi is now computed dynamically (i.e. current fill level),
         as the span between head to tail.
    
    As a result, dccp_ackvec_pending() is now simpler - the #ifdef is no longer
    necessary since buf_empty is always true when IP_DCCP_ACKVEC is not configured.
    
    Note on overflow handling:
    -------------------------
     The Ack Vector code previously simply started to drop packets when the
     Ack Vector buffer overflowed. This means that the userspace application
     will not be able to receive, only because of an Ack Vector storage problem.
    
     Furthermore, overflow may be transient, so that applications may later
     recover from the overflow. Recovering from dropped packets is more difficult
     (e.g. video key frames).
    
     Hence the patch uses a different policy: when the buffer overflows, the oldest
     entries are subsequently overwritten. This has a higher chance of recovery.
     Details are on http://www.erg.abdn.ac.uk/users/gerrit/dccp/notes/ack_vectors/

    dccp ccid-2: Ack Vector interface clean-up
    
    This patch brings the Ack Vector interface up to date. Its main purpose is
    to lay the basis for the subsequent patches of this set, which will use the
    new data structure fields and routines.
    
    There are no real algorithmic changes, rather an adaptation:
    
     (1) Replaced the static Ack Vector size (2) with a #define so that it can
         be adapted (with low loss / Ack Ratio, a value of 1 works, so 2 seems
         to be sufficient for the moment) and added a solution so that computing
         the ECN nonce will continue to work - even with larger Ack Vectors.
    
     (2) Replaced the #defines for Ack Vector states with a complete enum.
    
     (3) Replaced #defines to compute Ack Vector length and state with general
         purpose routines (inlines), and updated code to use these.
    
     (4) Added a `tail' field (conversion to circular buffer in subsequent patch).
    
     (5) Updated the (outdated) documentation for Ack Vector struct.
    
     (6) All sequence number containers now trimmed to 48 bits.
    
     (7) Removal of unused bits:
         * removed dccpav_ack_nonce from struct dccp_ackvec, since this is already
           redundantly stored in the `dccpavr_ack_nonce' (of Ack Vector record);
         * removed Elapsed Time for Ack Vectors (it was nowhere used);
         * replaced semantics of dccpavr_sent_len with dccpavr_ack_runlen, since
           the code needs to be able to remember the old run length;
         * reduced the de-/allocation routines (redundant / duplicate tests).
    
    
    Justification for removing Elapsed Time information [can be removed]:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     1. The Elapsed Time information for Ack Vectors was nowhere used in the code.
     2. DCCP does not implement rate-based pacing of acknowledgments. The only
        recommendation for always including Elapsed Time is in section 11.3 of
        RFC 4340: "Receivers that rate-pace acknowledgements SHOULD [...]
        include Elapsed Time options". But such is not the case here.
     3. It does not really improve estimation accuracy. The Elapsed Time field only
        records the time between the arrival of the last acknowledgeable packet and
        the time the Ack Vector is sent out. Since Linux does not (yet) implement
        delayed Acks, the time difference will typically be small, since often the
        arrival of a data packet triggers sending feedback at the HC-receiver.
    
    
    Justification for changes in de-/allocation routines [can be removed]:
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      * INIT_LIST_HEAD in dccp_ackvec_record_new was redundant, since the list
        pointers were later overwritten when the node was added via list_add();
      * dccp_ackvec_record_new() was called in a single place only;
      * calls to list_del_init() before calling dccp_ackvec_record_delete() were
        redundant, since subsequently the entire element was k-freed;
      * since all calls to dccp_ackvec_record_delete() were preceded to a call to
        list_del_init(), the WARN_ON test would never evaluate to true;
      * since all calls to dccp_ackvec_record_delete() were made from within
        list_for_each_entry_safe(), the test for avr == NULL was redundant;
      * list_empty() in ackvec_free was redundant, since the same condition is
        embedded in the loop condition of the subsequent list_for_each_entry_safe().

    dccp: Reduce noise in output and convert to ktime_t
    
    This fixes the problem that dccp_probe output can grow quite large without
    apparent benefit (many identical data points), creating huge files (up to
    over one Gigabyte for a few minutes' test run) which are very hard to
    post-process (in one instance it got so bad that gnuplot ate up all memory
    plus swap).
    
    The cause for the problem is that the kprobe is inserted into dccp_sendmsg(),
    which can be called in a polling-mode (whenever the TX queue is full due to
    congestion-control issues, EAGAIN is returned). This creates many very
    similar data points, i.e. the increase of processing time does not increase
    the quality/information of the probe output.
    
    The fix is to attach the probe to a different function -- write_xmit was
    chosen since it gets called continually (both via userspace and timer);
    an input-path function would stop sampling as soon as the other end stops
    sending feedback.
    
    For comparison the output file sizes for the same 20 second test
    run over a lossy link:
               * before / without patch:  118   Megabytes
               * after  / with patch:       1.2 Megabytes
    and there was much less noise in the output.
    
    To allow backward compatibility with scripts that people use, the now-unused
    `size' field in the output has been replaced with the CCID identifier. This
    also serves for future compatibility - support for CCID2 is work in progress
    (depends on the still unfinished SRTT/RTTVAR updates).
    
    While at it, the update to ktime_t was also performed.

    dccp: Fix the adjustments to AWL and SWL
    
    This fixes a problem and a potential loophole with regard to seqno/ackno
    validity: the problem is that the initial adjustments to AWL/SWL were
    only performed at the begin of the connection, during the handshake.
    
    Since the Sequence Window feature is always greater than Wmin=32 (7.5.2),
    it is however necessary to perform these adjustments at least for the first
    W/W' (variables as per 7.5.1) packets in the lifetime of a connection.
    
    This requirement is complicated by the fact that W/W' can change at any time
    during the lifetime of a connection.
    
    Therefore the consequence is to perform this safety check each time SWL/AWL
    are updated.
    
    A second problem solved by this patch is that the remote/local Sequence Window
    feature values (which set the bounds for AWL/SWL/SWH) are undefined until the
    feature negotiation has completed.
    
    During the initial handshake we have more stringent sequence number protection,
    the changes added by this patch effect that {A,S}W{L,H} are within the correct
    bounds at the instant that feature negotiation completes (since the SeqWin
    feature activation handlers call dccp_update_gsr/gss()).
    
    A detailed rationale is below -- can be removed from the commit message.
    
    
    1. Server sequence number checks during initial handshake
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    The server can not use the fields of the listening socket for seqno/ackno checks
    and thus needs to store all relevant information on a per-connection basis on
    the dccp_request socket. This is a size-constrained structure and has currently
    only ISS (dreq_iss) and ISR (dreq_isr) defined.
    Adding further fields (SW{L,H}, AW{L,H}) would increase the size of the struct
    and it is questionable whether this will have any practical gain. The currently
    implemented solution is as follows.
     * receiving first Request: dccp_v{4,6}_conn_request sets
                                ISR := P.seqno, ISS := dccp_v{4,6}_init_sequence()
    
     * sending first Response:  dccp_v{4,6}_send_response via dccp_make_response()
                                sets P.seqno := ISS, sets P.ackno := ISR
    
     * receiving retransmitted Request: dccp_check_req() overrides ISR := P.seqno
    
     * answering retransmitted Request: dccp_make_response() sets ISS += 1,
                                        otherwise as per first Response
    
     * completing the handshake: succeeds in dccp_check_req() for the first Ack
                                 where P.ackno == ISS (P.seqno is not tested)
    
     * creating child socket: ISS, ISR are copied from the request_sock
    
    This solution will succeed whenever the server can receive the Request and the
    subsequent Ack in succession, without retransmissions. If there is packet loss,
    the client needs to retransmit until this condition succeeds; it will otherwise
    eventually give up. Adding further fields to the request_sock could increase
    the robustness a bit, in that it would make possible to let a reordered Ack
    (from a retransmitted Response) pass. The argument against such a solution is
    that if the packet loss is not persistent and an Ack gets through, why not
    wait for the one answering the original response: if the loss is persistent, it
    is probably better to not start the connection in the first place.
    
    Long story short: the present design (by Arnaldo) is simple and will likely work
    just as well as a more complicated solution. As a consequence, {A,S}W{L,H} are
    not needed until the moment the request_sock is cloned into the accept queue.
    
    At that stage feature negotiation has completed, so that the values for the local
    and remote Sequence Window feature (7.5.2) are known, i.e. we are now in a better
    position to compute {A,S}W{L,H}.
    
    
    2. Client sequence number checks during initial handshake
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Until entering PARTOPEN the client does not need the adjustments, since it
    constrains the Ack window to the packet it sent.
    
     * sending first Request: dccp_v{4,6}_connect() choose ISS,
                              dccp_connect() then sets GAR := ISS (as per 8.5),
    			  dccp_transmit_skb() (with the previous bug fix) sets
    			         GSS := ISS, AWL := ISS, AWH := GSS
     * n-th retransmitted Request (with previous patch):
    	                  dccp_retransmit_skb() via timer calls
    			  dccp_transmit_skb(), which sets GSS := ISS+n
                              and then AWL := ISS, AWH := ISS+n
    
     * receiving any Response: dccp_rcv_request_sent_state_process()
    	                   -- accepts packet if AWL <= P.ackno <= AWH;
    			   -- sets GSR = ISR = P.seqno
    
     * sending the Ack completing the handshake: dccp_send_ack() calls
                               dccp_transmit_skb(), which sets GSS += 1
    			   and AWL := ISS, AWH := GSS

    dccp ccid-3: Remove dead states
    
    This patch is thanks to an investigation by Leandro Sales de Melo and his
    colleagues. They worked out two state diagrams which highlight the fact that
    the xxx_TERM states in CCID-3/4 are in fact not necessary.
    
    And this can be confirmed by in turn looking at the code: the xxx_TERM states
    are only ever set in ccid3_hc_{rx,tx}_exit(). These two functions are part
    of the following call chain:
    
     * ccid_hc_{tx,rx}_exit() are called from ccid_delete() only;
     * ccid_delete() invokes ccid_hc_{tx,rx}_exit() in the way of a destructor:
       after calling ccid_hc_{tx,rx}_exit(), the CCID is released from memory;
     * ccid_delete() is in turn called only by ccid_hc_{tx,rx}_delete();
     * ccid_hc_{tx,rx}_delete() is called only if
       - feature negotiation failed   (dccp_feat_activate_values()),
       - when changing the RX/TX CCID (to eject the current CCID),
       - when destroying the socket   (in dccp_destroy_sock()).
    
    In other words, when CCID-3 sets the state to xxx_TERM, it is at a time where
    no more processing should be going on, hence it is not necessary to introduce
    a dedicated exit state - this is implicit when unloading the CCID.
    
    The patch removes this state, one switch-statement collapses as a result.

    dccp ccid-3: Remove redundant 'options_received' struct
    
    The `options_received' struct is redundant, since it re-duplicates the existing
    `p' and `x_recv' fields. This patch removes the sub-struct and migrates the
    format conversion operations (cf. below) to ccid3_hc_tx_parse_options().
    
                         Why the fields are redundant
                         ----------------------------
    The Loss Event Rate p and the Receive Rate x_recv are initially 0 when first
    loading CCID-3, as ccid_new() zeroes out the entire ccid3_hc_tx_sock.
    
    When Loss Event Rate or Receive Rate options are received, they are stored by
    ccid3_hc_tx_parse_options() into the fields `ccid3or_loss_event_rate' and
    `ccid3or_receive_rate' of the sub-struct `options_received' in ccid3_hc_tx_sock.
    
    After parsing (considering only the established state - dccp_rcv_established()),
    the packet is passed on to ccid_hc_tx_packet_recv(). This calls the CCID-3
    specific routine ccid3_hc_tx_packet_recv(), which performs the following copy
    operations between fields of ccid3_hc_tx_sock:
    
     * hctx->options_received.ccid3or_receive_rate is copied into hctx->x_recv,
       after scaling it for fixpoint arithmetic, by 2^64;
     * hctx->options_received.ccid3or_loss_event_rate is copied into hctx->p,
       considering the above special cases; in addition, a value of 0 here needs to
       be mapped into p=0 (when no Loss Event Rate option has been received yet).

    dccp tfrc/ccid-3: Computing Loss Rate from Loss Event Rate
    
    This adds a function to take care of the following cases occurring in the
    computation of the Loss Rate p:
    
     * 1/(2^32-1) is mapped into 0% as per RFC 4342, 8.5;
     * 1/0        is mapped into the maximum of 100%;
     * we want to avoid that p = 1/x is rounded down to 0 when x is very large,
       since this means accidentally re-entering slow-start (indicated by p==0).
    
    In the last case, the minimum-resolution value of p is returned.
    
    Furthermore, a bug in ccid3_hc_rx_getsockopt is fixed (1/0 was mapped into ~0U),
    which now allows to consistently print the scaled p-values as
    
            printf("Loss Event Rate = %u.%04u %%\n", rx_info.tfrcrx_p / 10000,
                                                     rx_info.tfrcrx_p % 10000);

    dccp: Add packet type information to CCID-specific option parsing
    
    This patch ...
     1. adds packet type information to ccid_hc_{rx,tx}_parse_options(). This is
        necessary, since table 3 in RFC 4340, 5.8 leaves it to the CCIDs to state
        which options may (not) appear on what packet type.
    
     2. adds such a check for CCID-3's {Loss Event, Receive} Rate as specified in
        RFC 4340 8.3 ("Receive Rate options MUST NOT be sent on DCCP-Data packets")
        and 8.5 ("Loss Event Rate options MUST NOT be sent on DCCP-Data packets").
    
     3. removes an unused argument `idx' from ccid_hc_{rx,tx}_parse_options(). This
        is also no longer necessary, since the CCID-specific option-parsing routines
        are passed every single parameter of the type-length-value option encoding.
    
    Also added documentation and made argument naming scheme consistent.

    dccp ccid-3: Simplify and consolidate tx_parse_options
    
    This simplifies and consolidates the TX option-parsing code:
    
     1. The Loss Intervals option is not currently used, so dead code related to
        this option is removed. I am aware of no plans to support the option, but
        if someone wants to implement it (e.g. for inter-op tests), it is better
        to start afresh than having to also update currently unused code.
    
     2. The Loss Event and Receive Rate options have a lot of code in common (both
        are 32 bit, both have same length etc.), so this is consolidated.
    
     3. The test against GSR is not necessary, because
        - on first loading CCID3, ccid_new() zeroes out all fields in the socket;
        - ccid3_hc_tx_packet_recv() treats 0 and ~0U equivalently, due to
    
    	pinv = opt_recv->ccid3or_loss_event_rate;
    	if (pinv == ~0U || pinv == 0)
    		hctx->p = 0;
    
        - as a result, the sequence number field is removed from opt_recv.

    dccp ccid-3: Remove ugly RTT-sampling history lookup
    
    This removes the RTT-sampling function tfrc_tx_hist_rtt(), since
    
     1. it suffered from complex passing of return values (the return value both
        indicated successful lookup while the value doubled as RTT sample);
    
     2. when for some odd reason the sample value equalled 0, this triggered a bug
        warning about "bogus Ack", due to the ambiguity of the return value;
    
     3. on a passive host which has not sent anything the TX history is empty and
        thus will lead to unwanted "bogus Ack" warnings such as
        ccid3_hc_tx_packet_recv: server(e7b7d518): DATAACK with bogus ACK-28197148
        ccid3_hc_tx_packet_recv: server(e7b7d518): DATAACK with bogus ACK-26641606.
    
    The fix is to replace the implicit encoding by performing the steps manually.
    
    Furthermore, the "bogus Ack" warning has been removed, since it can actually be
    triggered due to several reasons (network reordering, old packet, (3) above),
    hence it is not very useful.

    dccp ccid-3: Bug fix for the inter-packet scheduling algorithm
    
    This fixes a subtle bug in the calculation of the inter-packet gap and shows
    that t_delta, as it is currently used, is not needed. And hence replaced.
    
    The algorithm from RFC 3448, 4.6 below continually computes a send time t_nom,
    which is initialised with the current time t_now; t_gran = 1E6 / HZ specifies
    the scheduling granularity, s the packet size, and X the sending rate:
    
      t_distance = t_nom - t_now;		// in microseconds
      t_delta    = min(t_ipi, t_gran) / 2;	// `delta' parameter in microseconds
    
      if (t_distance >= t_delta) {
    	reschedule after (t_distance / 1000) milliseconds;
      } else {
      	t_ipi  = s / X;			// inter-packet interval in usec
    	t_nom += t_ipi;			// compute the next send time
    	send packet now;
      }
    
    
    1) Description of the bug
    -------------------------
    Rescheduling requires a conversion into milliseconds, due to this call chain:
    
     * ccid3_hc_tx_send_packet() returns a timeout in milliseconds,
     * this value is converted by msecs_to_jiffies() in dccp_write_xmit(),
     * and finally used as jiffy-expires-value for sk_reset_timer().
    
    The highest jiffy resolution with HZ=1000 is 1 millisecond, so using a higher
    granularity does not make much sense here.
    
    As a consequence, values of t_distance < 1000 are truncated to 0. This issue
    has so far been resolved by using instead
    
      if (t_distance >= t_delta + 1000)
    	reschedule after (t_distance / 1000) milliseconds;
    
    The bug is in artificially inflating t_delta to t_delta' = t_delta + 1000. This
    is unnecessarily large, a more adequate value is t_delta' = max(t_delta, 1000).
    
    
    2) Consequences of using the corrected t_delta'
    -----------------------------------------------
    Since t_delta <= t_gran/2 = 10^6/(2*HZ), we have t_delta <= 1000 as long as
    HZ >= 500. This means that t_delta' = max(1000, t_delta) is constant at 1000.
    
    On the other hand, when using a coarse HZ value of HZ < 500, we have three
    sub-cases that can all be reduced to using another constant of t_gran/2.
    
     (a) The first case arises when t_ipi > t_gran. Here t_delta' is the constant
         t_delta' = max(1000, t_gran/2) = t_gran/2.
    
     (b) If t_ipi <= 2000 < t_gran = 10^6/HZ usec, then t_delta = t_ipi/2 <= 1000,
         so that t_delta' = max(1000, t_delta) = 1000 < t_gran/2.
    
     (c) If 2000 < t_ipi <= t_gran, we have t_delta' = max(t_delta, 1000) = t_ipi/2.
    
    In the second and third cases we have delay values less than t_gran/2, which is
    in the order of less than or equal to half a jiffy.
    
    How these are treated depends on how fractions of a jiffy are handled: they
    are either always rounded down to 0, or always rounded up to 1 jiffy (assuming
    non-zero values). In both cases the error is on average in the order of 50%.
    
    Thus we are not increasing the error when in the second/third case we replace
    a value less than t_gran/2 with 0, by setting t_delta' to the constant t_gran/2.
    
    
    3) Summary
    ----------
    Fixing (1) and considering (2), the patch replaces t_delta with a constant,
    whose value depends on CONFIG_HZ, changing the above algorithm to:
    
      if (t_distance >= t_delta')
    	reschedule after (t_distance / 1000) milliseconds;
    
    where t_delta' = 10^6/(2*HZ) if HZ < 500, and t_delta' = 1000 otherwise.

    dccp ccid-3: No more CCID control blocks in LISTEN state
    
    The CCIDs are activated as last of the features, at the end of the handshake,
    were the LISTEN state of the master socket is inherited into the server
    state of the child socket. Thus, the only states visible to CCIDs now are
    OPEN/PARTOPEN, and the closing states.
    
    This allows to remove tests which were previously necessary to protect
    against referencing a socket in the listening state (in CCID3), but which
    now have become redundant.
    
    As a further byproduct of enabling the CCIDs only after the connection has been
    fully established, several typecast-initialisations of ccid3_hc_{rx,tx}_sock
    can now be eliminated:
     * the CCID is loaded, so it is not necessary to test if it is NULL,
     * if it is possible to load a CCID and leave the private area NULL, then this
        is a bug, which should crash loudly - and earlier,
     * the test for state==OPEN || state==PARTOPEN now reduces only to the closing
       phase (e.g. when the node has received an unexpected Reset).

     * code becomes hard to read;
     * multiple-line statements are almost inevitable even for simple expressions;
    The prefixes are not really necessary (compare with "struct tcp_sock").
    
    There had been previous discussion of this on dccp@vger, but so far this was
    not followed up (most people agreed that the prefixes are too long).

    dccp: Special case of the MPS for client-PARTOPEN with DataAcks
    
    To increase robustness, it is necessary to resend Confirm feature-negotiation
    options, even though the RFC does not mandate it. But feature negotiation
    options can take (much) more room than the options on common DataAck packets.
    
    Instead of reducing the MPS always for a case which only applies to the three
    messages send during initial handshake, this patch devises a special case:
    
       if the payload length of the DataAck in PARTOPEN is too large, an Ack is sent
       to carry the options, and the feature-negotiation list is then flushed.
    
       This means that the server gets two Acks for one Response. If both Acks get
       lost, it is probably better to restart the connection anyway and devising yet
       another special-case does not seem worth the extra complexity.
    
    The patch (over-)estimates the expected overhead to be 32*4 bytes -- commonly
    seen values were 20-90 bytes for initial feature-negotiation options.
    
    It uses sizeof(u32) to mean "aligned units of 4 bytes". For consistency,
    another use of sizeof is modified.

    dccp: Leave headroom for options when calculating the MPS
    
    The Maximum Packet Size (MPS) is of interest for applications which want
    to transfer data, so it is only relevant to the data transfer phase of a
    connection (unless one wants to send data on the DCCP-Request, but that is
    not considered here).
    
    The strategy chosen to deal with this requirement is to leave room for only
    such options that may appear on data packets.
    
    A special consideration applies to Ack Vectors: this is purely guesswork,
    since these can have any length between 3 and 1020 bytes. The strategy
    chosen here is to subtract a configurable minimum, the value of 16 bytes
    (2 bytes for type/length plus 14 Ack Vector cells) has been found by
    experimentatation. If people experience this as too much or too little,
    this could later be turned into a Kconfig option.
    
    There are currently no CCID-specific header options which may appear on data
    packets, hence it is not necessary to define a corresponding CCID field.

    dccp: Support for the exchange of NN options in established state
    
    In contrast to static feature negotiation at the begin of a connection, which
    establishes the capabilities of both endpoints, this patch introduces support
    for dynamic exchange of feature negotiation options.
    
    Such a dynamic exchange is necessary in at least two cases:
     * CCID-2's Ack Ratio (RFC 4341, 6.1.2) which changes during the connection;
     * Sequence Window values that, as per RFC 4340, 7.5.2, should be sent "as
       as the connection progresses".
    
    Both are NN (non-negotiable) features. Hence dynamic feature "negotiation" is
    distinguished from static/pre-connection negotiation by the following:
     * no new capabilities are negotiated (those that matter for the connection
       are negotiated prior to setting up the connection, comparable to SIP);
     * features must be understood by each endpoint: as per RFC 4340, 6.4,
       Sequence Window is "Req'd" and Ack Ratio must be understood when CCID-2
       is used as per the note underneath Table 4.
    
    These characteristics are reflected in the implementation:
     * only NN options can be exchanged after connection setup;
     * NN options are activated directly after validating them. The rationale is
       that a peer must accept every valid NN value (RFC 4340, 6.3.2), hence it
       will either accept the value and send a "Confirm R", or it will send an
       empty Confirm (which will reset the connection according to FN rules).
     * An Ack is scheduled directly after activation to accelerate communicating
       the update to the peer.

    dccp: Initialisation and type-checking of feature sysctls
    
    This patch takes care of initialising and type-checking sysctls related to
    feature negotiation. Type checking is important since some of the sysctls
    now directly act on the feature-negotiation process.
    
    The sysctls are initialised with the known default values for each feature.
    For the type-checking the value constraints from RFC 4340 are used:
    
     * Sequence Window uses the specified Wmin=32, the maximum is ulong (4 bytes),
       tested and confirmed that it works up to 4294967295 - for Gbps speed;
     * Ack Ratio is between 0 .. 0xffff (2-byte unsigned integer);
     * CCIDs are between 0 .. 255;
     * request_retries, retries1, retries2 also between 0..255 for good measure;
     * tx_qlen is checked to be non-negative;
     * sync_ratelimit remains as before.

    dccp: Implement both feature-local and feature-remote Sequence Window feature
    
    This adds full support for local/remote Sequence Window feature, from which the
      * sequence-number-validity (W) and
      * acknowledgment-number-validity (W') windows
    derive as specified in RFC 4340, 7.5.3.
    
    Specifically, the following changes are introduced:
      * integrated new socket fields into dccp_sk;
      * updated the update_gsr/gss routines with regard to these fields;
      * updated handler code: the Sequence Window feature is located at the TX side,
        so the local feature is meant if the handler-rx flag is false;
      * the initialisation of `rcv_wnd' in reqsk is removed, since
        - rcv_wnd is not used by the code anywhere;
        - sequence number checks are not done in the LISTEN state (cf. 7.5.3);
        - dccp_check_req checks the Ack number validity more rigorously;
      * the `struct dccp_minisock' became empty and is now removed.
    
    Until the handshake completes with activating negotiated values, the local/remote
    Sequence-Window values are undefined and thus can not reliably be estimated.
    This issue is addressed in a separate patch.

    dccp ccid-2: Phase out the use of boolean Ack Vector sysctl
    
    This removes the use of the sysctl and the minisock variable for the Send Ack
    Vector feature, which is now handled fully dynamically via feature negotiation;
    i.e. when CCID2 is enabled, Ack Vectors are automatically enabled (as per
    RFC 4341, 4.).
    
    Using a sysctl in parallel to this implementation would open the door to
    crashes, since much of the code relies on tests of the boolean minisock /
    sysctl variable. Thus, this patch replaces all tests of type
    
    	if (dccp_msk(sk)->dccpms_send_ack_vector)
    		/* ... */
    with
    	if (dp->dccps_hc_rx_ackvec != NULL)
    		/* ... */
    
    The dccps_hc_rx_ackvec is allocated by the dccp_hdlr_ackvec() when feature
    negotiation concluded that Ack Vectors are to be used on the half-connection.
    Otherwise, it is NULL (due to dccp_init_sock/dccp_create_openreq_child),
    so that the test is a valid one.
    
    The activation handler for Ack Vectors is called as soon as the feature
    negotiation has concluded at the
     * server when the Ack marking the transition RESPOND => OPEN arrives;
     * client after it has sent its ACK, marking the transition REQUEST => PARTOPEN.
    
    Adding the sequence number of the Response packet to the Ack Vector has been
    removed, since
     (a) connection establishment implies that the Response has been received;
     (b) the CCIDs only look at packets received in the (PART)OPEN state, i.e.
         this entry will always be ignored;
     (c) it can not be used for anything useful - to detect loss for instance, only
         packets received after the loss can serve as pseudo-dupacks.

    dccp: Remove manual influence on NDP Count feature
    
    Updating the NDP count feature is handled automatically now:
     * for CCID-2 it is disabled, since the code does not use NDP counts;
     * for CCID-3 it is enabled, as NDP counts are used to determine loss lengths.
    
    Allowing the user to change NDP values leads to unpredictable and failing
    behaviour, since it is then possible to disable NDP counts even when they
    are needed (e.g. in CCID-3).
    
    This means that only those user settings are sensible that agree with the
    values for Send NDP Count implied by the choice of CCID. But those settings
    are already activated by the feature negotiation (CCID dependency tracking),
    hence this form of support is redundant.
    
    At startup the initialisation of the NDP count feature is with the default
    value of 0, which is done implicitly by the zeroing-out of the socket when
    it is allocated. If the choice of CCID or feature negotiation enables NDP
    count, this will then be updated via the NDP activation handler.

    dccp: Remove obsolete parts of the old CCID interface
    
    The TX/RX CCIDs of the minisock are now redundant: similar to the Ack Vector
    case, their value equals initially that of the sysctl, but at the end of
    feature negotiation may be something different.
    
    The old interface removed by this patch thus has been replaced by the newer
    interface to dynamically query the currently loaded CCIDs earlier in this
    patch set.
    
    Also removed the constructors for the TX CCID and the RX CCID, since the
    switch rx/non-rx is done by the handler in minisocks.c (and the handler is
    the only place in the code where CCIDs are loaded).

    dccp: Integration of dynamic feature activation - part 3 (client side)
    
    This integrates feature-activation in the client, with these details:
    
     1. When dccp_parse_options() fails, the reset code is already set, request_sent
        _state_process() currently overrides this with `Packet Error', which is not
        intended - so changed to use the reset code set in dccp_parse_options();
    
     2. There was a FIXME to change the error code when dccp_ackvec_add() fails.
        I have looked this up and found that:
        * the check whether ackno < ISN is already made earlier,
        * this Response is likely the 1st packet with an Ackno that the client gets,
        * so when dccp_ackvec_add() fails, the reason is likely not a packet error.
    
     3. When feature negotiation fails, the socket should be marked as not usable,
        so that the application is notified that an error occurs. This is achieved
        by a new label, which uses an error code of `Aborted' and which sets the
        socket state to CLOSED, as well as sk_err.
    
     4. Avoids parsing the Ack twice in Respond state by not doing option processing
        again in dccp_rcv_respond_partopen_state_process (as option processing has
        already been done on the request_sock in dccp_check_req).
    
    Since this addresses congestion-control initialisation, a corresponding
    FIXME has been removed.

    This first patch out of three replaces the hardcoded default settings with

    Note on retransmitting Confirm options:
    ---------------------------------------
    This patch also defers flushing the client feature-negotiation queue,
    due to the following considerations.
    
    As long as the client is in PARTOPEN, it needs to retransmit the Confirm
    options for the Change options received on the DCCP-Response from the server.
    
    Otherwise, if the packet containing the Confirm options gets dropped in the
    network, the connection aborts due to undefined feature negotiation state.
    
    Thanks to Leandro Melo de Sales who reported a bug in an earlier revision
    of the patch set, resulting from not retransmitting the Confirm options.
    
    The patch now ensures that the client feature-negotiation queue is flushed only
    when entering the OPEN state. Since confirmed Change options are removed as
    soon as they are confirmed (in the DCCP-Response), this ensures that Confirm
    options are retransmitted.

    dccp: Preference list reconciliation
    
    This provides two functions to
     * reconcile preference lists (with appropriate return codes) and
     * reorder the preference list if successful reconciliation changed the
       preferred value.
    
    The patch also removes the old code for processing SP/NN Change options, since
    new code to process these is mostly there already; related references have been
    commented out.
    
    The code for processing Change options follows in the next patch.

    dccp: Integrate feature-negotiation insertion code
    
    The patch implements insertion of feature negotiation at the server (listening
    and request socket) and the client (connecting socket).
    
    In dccp_insert_options(), several statements have been grouped together now
    to achieve (I hope) better efficiency by reducing the number of tests each
    packet has to go through:
     - Ack Vectors are sent if the packet is neither a Data or a Request packet;
     - a previous issue is corrected - feature negotiation options are allowed
       on DataAck packets (5.8).

    dccp: Set per-connection CCIDs via socket options
    
    With this patch, TX/RX CCIDs can now be changed on a per-connection basis, which
    overrides the defaults set by the global sysctl variables for TX/RX CCIDs.
    
    To make full use of this facility, the remaining patches of this patch set are
    needed, which track dependencies and activate negotiated feature values.
    
    Note on the maximum number of CCIDs that can be registered:
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    The maximum number of CCIDs that can be registered on the socket is constrained
    by the space in a Confirm/Change feature negotiation option.
    
    The space in these in turn depends on the size of header options as defined
    in RFC 4340, 5.8. Since this is a recurring constant, it has been moved from
    ackvec.h into linux/dccp.h, clarifying its purpose.
    
    Relative to this size, the maximum number of CCID identifiers that can be
    present in a Confirm option (which always consumes 1 byte more than a Change
    option, cf. 6.1) is 2 bytes less than the maximum TLV size: one for the
    CCID-feature-type and one for the selected value.

    dccp: Deprecate Ack Ratio sysctl
    
    This patch deprecates the Ack Ratio sysctl, since
     * Ack Ratio is entirely ignored by CCID-3 and CCID-4,
     * Ack Ratio currently doesn't work in CCID-2 (i.e. is always set to 1);
     * even if it would work in CCID-2, there is no point for a user to change it:
       - Ack Ratio is constrained by cwnd (RFC 4341, 6.1.2),
       - if Ack Ratio > cwnd, the system resorts to spurious RTO timeouts
         (since waiting for Acks which will never arrive in this window),
       - cwnd is not a user-configurable value.
    
    The only reasonable place for Ack Ratio is to print it for debugging. It is
    planned to do this later on, as part of e.g. dccp_probe.
    
    With this patch Ack Ratio is now under full control of feature negotiation:
     * Ack Ratio is resolved as a dependency of the selected CCID;
     * if the chosen CCID supports it (i.e. CCID == CCID-2), Ack Ratio is set to
       the default of 2, following RFC 4340, 11.3 - "New connections start with Ack
       Ratio 2 for both endpoints";
     * what happens then is part of another patch set, since it concerns the
       dynamic update of Ack Ratio while the connection is in full flight.

    dccp: Mechanism to resolve CCID dependencies
    
    This adds a hook to resolve features whose value depends on the choice of
    CCID. It is done at the server since it can only be done after the CCID
    values have been negotiated; i.e. the client will add its CCID preference

    with the local preference list of the server.

    dccp: Resolve dependencies of features on choice of CCID
    
    This provides a missing link in the code chain, as several features implicitly
    depend and/or rely on the choice of CCID. Most notably, this is the Send Ack Vector
    feature, but also Ack Ratio and Send Loss Event Rate (also taken care of).
    
    For Send Ack Vector, the situation is as follows:
     * since CCID2 mandates the use of Ack Vectors, there is no point in allowing
       endpoints which use CCID2 to disable Ack Vector features such a connection;
    
     * a peer with a TX CCID of CCID2 will always expect Ack Vectors, and a peer
       with a RX CCID of CCID2 must always send Ack Vectors (RFC 4341, sec. 4);
    
     * for all other CCIDs, the use of (Send) Ack Vector is optional and thus
       negotiable. However, this implies that the code negotiating the use of Ack
       Vectors also supports it (i.e. is able to supply and to either parse or
       ignore received Ack Vectors). Since this is not the case (CCID-3 has no Ack
       Vector support), the use of Ack Vectors is here disabled, with a comment
       in the source code.
    
    An analogous consideration arises for the Send Loss Event Rate feature,
    since the CCID-3 implementation does not support the loss interval options
    of RFC 4342. To make such use explicit, corresponding feature-negotiation
    options are inserted which signal the use of the loss event rate option,
    as it is used by the CCID3 code.
    
    Lastly, the values of the Ack Ratio feature are matched to the choice of CCID.
    
    The patch implements this as a function which is called after the user has
    made all other registrations for changing default values of features.
    
    The table is variable-length, the reserved (and hence for feature-negotiation
    invalid, confirmed by considering section 19.4 of RFC 4340) feature number `0'
    is used to mark the end of the table.

    dccp: Query supported CCIDs
    
    This provides a data structure to record which CCIDs are locally supported
    and three accessor functions:
     - a test function for internal use which is used to validate CCID requests
       made by the user;
     - a copy function so that the list can be used for feature-negotiation;
     - documented getsockopt() support so that the user can query capabilities.
    
    The data structure is a table which is filled in at compile-time with the
    list of available CCIDs (which in turn depends on the Kconfig choices).
    
    Using the copy function for cloning the list of supported CCIDs is useful for
    feature negotiation, since the negotiation is now with the full list of available
    CCIDs (e.g. {2, 3}) instead of the default value {2}. This means negotiation
    will not fail if the peer requests to use CCID3 instead of CCID2.

    dccp: Limit feature negotiation to connection setup phase
    
    This patch starts the new implementation of feature negotiation:
     1. Although it is theoretically possible to perform feature negotiation at any
        time (and RFC 4340 supports this), in practice this is prohibitively complex,
        as it requires to put traffic on hold for each new negotiation.
     2. As a byproduct of restricting feature negotiation to connection setup, the
        feature-negotiation retransmit timer is no longer required. This part is now
        mapped onto the protocol-level retransmission.
        Details indicating why timers are no longer needed can be found on

    dccp: Basic data structure for feature negotiation
    
    This patch prepares for the new and extended feature-negotiation routines.
    
    The following feature-negotiation data structures are provided:
    	* a container for the various (SP or NN) values,
    	* symbolic state names to track feature states,
    	* an entry struct which holds all current information together,
    	* elementary functions to fill in and process these structures.
    
    Entry structs are arranged as FIFO for the following reason: RFC 4340 specifies
    that if multiple options of the same type are present, they are processed in the
    order of their appearance in the packet; which means that this order needs to be
    preserved in the local data structure (the later insertion code also respects
    this order).
    
    The struct list_head has been chosen for the following reasons: the most
    frequent operations are
     * add new entry at tail (when receiving Change or setting socket options);
     * delete entry (when Confirm has been received);
     * deep copy of entire list (cloning from listening socket onto request socket).
    
    The NN value has been set to 64 bit, which is a currently sufficient upper limit
    (Sequence Window feature has 48 bit).

    dccp: Empty the write queue when disconnecting
    
    dccp_disconnect() can be called due to several reasons:
    
     1. when the connection setup failed (inet_stream_connect());
     2. when shutting down (inet_shutdown(), inet_csk_listen_stop());
     3. when aborting the connection (dccp_close() with 0 linger time).
    
    In case (1) the write queue is empty. This patch empties the write queue,
    if in case (2) or (3) it was not yet empty.
    
    This avoids triggering the write-queue BUG_TRAP in sk_stream_kill_queues()
    later on.
    
    It also seems natural to do: when breaking an association, to delete all
    packets that were originally intended for the soon-disconnected end (compare
    with call to tcp_write_queue_purge in tcp_disconnect()).

    dccp: Fill in the Data fields for "Option Error" Resets
    
    This updates the use of the `out_invalid_option' label, which produces a
    Reset (code 5, "Option Error"), to fill in the  Data1...Data3 fields as
    specified in RFC 4340, 5.6.

    dccp: Silently ignore options with nonsensical lengths
    
    This updates the option-parsing code with regard to RFC 4340, 5.8:
     "[..] options with nonsensical lengths (length byte less than two or more
      than the remaining space in the options portion of the header) MUST be
      ignored, and any option space following an option with nonsensical length
      MUST likewise be ignored."
    
    Hence in the following cases erratic options will be ignored:
     1. The type byte of a multi-byte option is the last byte of the header
        options (i.e. effective option length of 1).
     2. The value of the length byte is less than the minimum 2. This has been
        changed from previously 3: although no multi-byte option with a length
        less than 3 yet exists (cf. table 3 in 5.8), a length of 2 is valid.
        (The switch-statement in dccp_parse has further per-option length checks.)
     3. The option length exceeds the length of the remaining option space.

    dccp: Always generate a Reset in response to option errors
    
    RFC4340 states that if a packet is received with an option error (such as a
    Mandatory Option as the last byte of the option list), the endpoint should
    repond with a Reset.
    
    In the LISTEN and RESPOND states, the endpoint correctly reponds with Reset,
    while in the REQUEST/OPEN states, packets with option errors are just ignored.
    
    The packet sequence is as follows:
    
    Case 1:
    
      Endpoint A                           Endpoint B
      (CLOSED)                             (CLOSED)
    
                   <----------------       REQUEST
    
      RESPONSE     ----------------->      (*1)
      (with invalid option)
                   <----------------       RESET
                                           (with Reset Code 5, "Option Error")
    
      (*1) currently just ignored, no Reset is sent
    
    Case 2:
    
      Endpoint A                           Endpoint B
      (OPEN)                               (OPEN)
    
      DATA-ACK     ----------------->      (*2)
      (with invalid option)
                   <----------------       RESET
                                           (with Reset Code 5, "Option Error")
    
      (*2) currently just ignored, no Reset is sent
    
    This patch fixes the problem, by generating a Reset instead of silently
    ignoring option errors.

    ixgbe: should not use HW_CSUM, should use IP* flags
    
    as mentioned by Herbert, our hardware supports IP offloads, not full
    checksum offloads for any protocol in existence (even though the
    hardware just provides generic csum support over any range of bytes)

    ixgbe: Lock RSS seed, move rx_buf_len to the rx_ring
    
    This locks the seed down so loading/unloading the driver will present
    predictable hashing from RSS.  Also move the rx_buf_len out of the adapter
    struct, and into the Rx ring struct.

    ixgbe: fix rx csum return status misinterpretation
    
    the driver was misinterpreting rx_csum return value in the descriptor
    so occassionally we would indicate an rx_csum error in our stats
    when there was none.  This would have no effect on traffic because
    we would just hand the packet to the stack anyway without the offload
    flag set, but would increase CPU for those packets that needed a recompute.

    sfc: Speed up loopback self-test
    
    Add efx_poll_loopback() function to test for successful completion of test.
    Change efx_test_loopback() to end the test after 1 ms if
    efx_poll_loopback() indicates success, and otherwise to wait for 100 ms
    as before.
    
    While we're here, rename efx_{rx,tx}_loopback() to
    efx_{begin,end}_loopback() which more accurately reflect their
    purpose.

    sfc: Use separate hardware TX queues to select checksum generation
    
    Checksum generation is an attribute of our hardware TX queues, not TX
    descriptors.  We previously used a single queue and turned checksum
    generation on or off as requested through ethtool.  However, this can
    result in regenerating checksums in raw packets that should not be
    modified.  We now create 2 hardware TX queues with checksum generation
    on or off.  They are presented to the net core as one queue since it
    does not know how to select between them.
    
    The self-test verifies that a bad checksum is unaltered on the queue
    with checksum generation off.

    [ARM] 5218/1: arm: improved futex support
    
    Linux/ARM currently doesn't support robust or PI futexes.
    The problem is that the kernel wants to perform certain ops
    (cmpxchg, set, add, or, andn, xor) atomically on user-space
    addresses, and ARM's futex.h doesn't support that.
    
    This patch adds that support, but only for uniprocessor machines.
    For UP it's enough to disable preemption to ensure mutual exclusion
    with other software agents (futexes don't need to care about other
    hardware agents, fortunately).
    
    This patch is based on one posted by Khem Raj on 2007-08-01
    <http://marc.info/?l=linux-arm-kernel&m=118599407413016&w=2>.
    (That patch is included in the -RT kernel patches.)
    My changes since that version include:
    * corrected implementation of FUTEX_OP_ANDN (must complement oparg)
    * added missing memory clobber to futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic()
    * removed spinlock because it's unnecessary for UP and insufficient
      for SMP, instead the code is restricted to UP and relies on the
      fact that pagefault_disable() also disables preemption
    * coding style cleanups
    
    Tested on ARMv5 XScales with the glibc-2.6 nptl test suite.

    As mentioned in commit 796969104cab0d454dbc792ad0d12a4f365a8564,
    and because of commit b03a5b7559563dafdbe52f8b5d8e453a914db941,
    the direct calling of kprobe_trap_handler() can be removed.

    sparc: remove CONFIG_SUN4
    
    While doing some easy cleanups on the sparc code I noticed that the
    CONFIG_SUN4 code seems to be worse than the rest - there were some
    "I don't know how it should work, but the current code definitely cannot
    work." places.
    
    And while I have seen people running Linux on machines like a
    SPARCstation 5 a few years ago I don't recall having seen sun4
    machines, even less ones running Linux.

    sparc64: Check for RTC class device in update_persistent_clock().
    
    As we convert the various by-hand sparc64 RTC drivers to use the
    generic RTC framework and drivers, we need to keep the NTP
    set_rtc_mmss() support via update_persistent_clock() working.
    
    In the end, after all the RTC device cases are converted, this
    local set_rtc_mmss() function will be deleted.

    b43: Rewrite TX power adjustment
    
    This patch rewrites the TX power recalculation algorithms to scale better
    with changed enviromnent. If there's low
    TX traffic, the power will be checked against the desired values
    every 60 seconds.
    If there is high TX traffic, the check is redone every 2 seconds. This improves
    the reaction times a lot and confuses the rate control less.
    It will also reduce the time it initially takes to tune to a new TX power
    value. With the old algorithm it could take about 30 to 45 seconds to settle to
    a new power value. This will happen in about two to four seconds now.

    This patch implements a dynamic "ops" based PHY API.
    This is needed in order to conveniently support future PHY types
    to avoid the "switch"-hell.
    
    This patch does not change any functionality. It just moves lots
    of code from one place to another and adjusts it for the changed

    rt2x00: Only configure hardware when radio is enabled
    
    Some hardware configuration registers such as antenna and channel configuration
    can only be written when the radio is enabled. Previously, we didn't consider
    this, so some configuration items could be set inconsistently after reenabling
    the radio. This patch changes the config() handler to only reprogram the
    hardware when the radio is enabled. Configuration changes that are made while
    the radio is off are postponed until the radio is switched back on. We also
    leave the radio turned off during initialization and only enable it when
    requested by mac80211. This allows us to get rid of the DIRTY_CONFIG flag,
    because the device is now guaranteed to be completely initialized when brought
    up by mac80211.

    rt2x00: Fix race conditions in flag handling
    
    Some of the flags should be accessed atomically to
    prevent race conditions. The flags that are most important
    are those that can change often and indicate the actual
    state of the device, queue or queue entry.
    
    The big flag rename was done to move all state flags to
    the same naming type as the other rt2x00dev flags and
    made sure all places where the flags were used were changed. ;)
    
    Thanks to Stephen for most of the queue flags updates,
    which fixes some of the most obvious consequences of the
    race conditions. Among those the notorious:
    
    rt2x00queue_write_tx_frame: Error - Arrived at non-free entry in the non-full queue 0.
    rt2x00queue_write_tx_frame: Error - Arrived at non-free entry in the non-full queue 0.

    however, all of the extraction routines extract pseudo data for these
    fields from regions that are all 1's resulting in a hardware address
    of FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. This patch forces such a fill at the beginning of
    the data extraction process, and only does the formal extraction if the
    SPROM rev is 1 or 2.

    Clean up and extend scan result processing by storing all the IEs from
    Beacon/Probe Response frames in a single block instead of allocating
    memory for each specific IE separately. This removes lot of unnecessary
    code and automatically supports reporting of new IEs (e.g., IEEE
    802.11r) into user space without need to manually extend mac80211
    scanning code whenever a new protocol adds IE(s).

    sound: make OSS sound core optional
    
    sound/sound_core.c implements soundcore.ko and contains two parts -
    sound_class which is shared by both ALSA and OSS and device
    redirection support for OSS.  It's always compiled when any sound
    support is enabled although it's necessary only when OSS (the actual
    one or emulation) is enabled.  This is slightly wasteful and as device
    redirection always registers character device region for major 14, it
    prevents alternative implementation.
    
    This patch introduces a new config SOUND_OSS_CORE which is selected
    iff OSS support is actually necessary and build the OSS core part
    conditionally.
    
    If OSS is disabled, soundcore merely contains sound_class but leaving
    it that way seems to be the simplest approach as otherwise sound_class
    should be in ALSA core file if OSS is disabled but should be in
    soundcore if OSS is enabled.  Also, there's also the user confusion
    factor.

    dlm: detect available userspace daemon
    
    If dlm_controld (the userspace daemon that controls the setup and
    recovery of the dlm) fails, the kernel should shut down the lockspaces
    in the kernel rather than leaving them running.  This is detected by
    having dlm_controld hold a misc device open while running, and if
    the kernel detects a close while the daemon is still needed, it stops
    the lockspaces in the kernel.
    
    Knowing that the userspace daemon isn't running also allows the
    lockspace create/remove routines to avoid waiting on the daemon
    for join/leave operations.

    SELinux: add boundary support and thread context assignment
    
    The purpose of this patch is to assign per-thread security context
    under a constraint. It enables multi-threaded server application
    to kick a request handler with its fair security context, and
    helps some of userspace object managers to handle user's request.
    
    When we assign a per-thread security context, it must not have wider
    permissions than the original one. Because a multi-threaded process
    shares a single local memory, an arbitary per-thread security context
    also means another thread can easily refer violated information.
    
    The constraint on a per-thread security context requires a new domain
    has to be equal or weaker than its original one, when it tries to assign
    a per-thread security context.
    
    Bounds relationship between two types is a way to ensure a domain can
    never have wider permission than its bounds. We can define it in two
    explicit or implicit ways.
    
    The first way is using new TYPEBOUNDS statement. It enables to define
    a boundary of types explicitly. The other one expand the concept of
    existing named based hierarchy. If we defines a type with "." separated
    name like "httpd_t.php", toolchain implicitly set its bounds on "httpd_t".
    
    This feature requires a new policy version.
    The 24th version (POLICYDB_VERSION_BOUNDARY) enables to ship them into
    kernel space, and the following patch enables to handle it.

    sched: call resched_task() conditionally from new task wake up path
    
    - During wake up of a new task, task_new_fair() can do a resched_task()
      on the current task. Later in the code path, check_preempt_curr() also ends
      up doing the same, which can be avoided. Check if TIF_NEED_RESCHED is
      already set for the current task.
    
    - task_new_fair() does a resched_task() on the current task unconditionally.
      This can be done only in case when child runs before the parent.
    
    So this is a small speedup.

    x86: make poll_idle behave more like the other idle methods
    
    Make poll_idle() behave more like the other idle methods.
    
    Currently, poll_idle() returns immediately.  The other
    idle methods all wait indefinately for some condition
    to come true before returning.  poll_idle should emulate
    these other methods and also wait for a return condition,
    in this case, for need_resched() to become 'true'.
    
    Without this delay the idle loop spends all of its time
    in the outer loop that calls poll_idle.  This outer loop,
    these days, does real work, some of it under rcu locks.
    That work should only be done when idle is entered and
    when idle exits, not continuously while idle is spinning.

    tcp: Skip empty hash buckets faster in /proc/net/tcp
    
    On most systems most of the TCP established/time-wait hash buckets are empty.
    When walking the hash table for /proc/net/tcp their read locks would
    always be aquired just to find out they're empty. This patch changes the code
    to check first if the buckets have any entries before taking the lock, which
    is much cheaper than taking a lock. Since the hash tables are large
    this makes a measurable difference on processing /proc/net/tcp,
    especially on architectures with slow read_lock (e.g. PPC)
    
    On a 2GB Core2 system time cat /proc/net/tcp > /dev/null (with a mostly
    empty hash table) goes from 0.046s to 0.005s.
    
    On systems with slower atomics (like P4 or POWER4) or larger hash tables
    (more RAM) the difference is much higher.
    
    This can be noticeable because there are some daemons around who regularly
    scan /proc/net/tcp.
    
    Original idea for this patch from Marcus Meissner, but redone by me.

    x86: generate names for /proc/cpuinfo from <asm/cpufeature.h>
    
    We have had a number of cases where <asm/cpufeature.h> (and its
    predecessors) have diverged substantially from the names list in
    /proc/cpuinfo.  This patch generates the latter from the former.
    
    It retains the option for explicitly overriding the strings, but by
    making that require a separate action it should at least be less
    likely to happen.
    
    It would be good to do a future pass and rename strings that are
    gratuituously different in the kernel (/proc/cpuinfo is a userspace
    interface and must remain constant.)

    At the same time, this moved the (only called from one place) function

    dccp: Toggle debug output without module unloading
    
    This sets the sysfs permissions so that root can toggle the `debug'
    parameter available for nearly every DCCP module. This is useful
    since there are various module inter-dependencies. The debug flag
    can now be toggled at runtime using
    
      echo 1 > /sys/module/dccp/parameters/dccp_debug
      echo 1 > /sys/module/dccp_ccid2/parameters/ccid2_debug

      echo 1 > /sys/module/dccp_tfrc_lib/parameters/tfrc_debug

    dccp: Empty the write queue when disconnecting
    
    dccp_disconnect() can be called due to several reasons:
    
     1. when the connection setup failed (inet_stream_connect());
     2. when shutting down (inet_shutdown(), inet_csk_listen_stop());
     3. when aborting the connection (dccp_close() with 0 linger time).
    
    In case (1) the write queue is empty. This patch empties the write queue,
    if in case (2) or (3) it was not yet empty.
    
    This avoids triggering the write-queue BUG_TRAP in sk_stream_kill_queues()
    later on.
    
    It also seems natural to do: when breaking an association, to delete all
    packets that were originally intended for the soon-disconnected end (compare
    with call to tcp_write_queue_purge in tcp_disconnect()).

    specified in RFC 4340, 5.6.

    dccp: Silently ignore options with nonsensical lengths
    
    This updates the option-parsing code with regard to RFC 4340, 5.8:
     "[..] options with nonsensical lengths (length byte less than two or more
      than the remaining space in the options portion of the header) MUST be
      ignored, and any option space following an option with nonsensical length
      MUST likewise be ignored."
    
    Hence in the following cases erratic options will be ignored:
     1. The type byte of a multi-byte option is the last byte of the header
        options (i.e. effective option length of 1).
     2. The value of the length byte is less than the minimum 2. This has been
        changed from previously 3: although no multi-byte option with a length
        less than 3 yet exists (cf. table 3 in 5.8), a length of 2 is valid.
        (The switch-statement in dccp_parse has further per-option length checks.)
     3. The option length exceeds the length of the remaining option space.

    dccp: Always generate a Reset in response to option errors
    
    RFC4340 states that if a packet is received with an option error (such as a
    Mandatory Option as the last byte of the option list), the endpoint should
    repond with a Reset.
    
    In the LISTEN and RESPOND states, the endpoint correctly reponds with Reset,
    while in the REQUEST/OPEN states, packets with option errors are just ignored.
    
    The packet sequence is as follows:
    
    Case 1:
    
      Endpoint A                           Endpoint B
      (CLOSED)                             (CLOSED)
    
                   <----------------       REQUEST
    
      RESPONSE     ----------------->      (*1)
      (with invalid option)
                   <----------------       RESET
                                           (with Reset Code 5, "Option Error")
    
      (*1) currently just ignored, no Reset is sent
    
    Case 2:
    
      Endpoint A                           Endpoint B
      (OPEN)                               (OPEN)
    
      DATA-ACK     ----------------->      (*2)
      (with invalid option)
                   <----------------       RESET
                                           (with Reset Code 5, "Option Error")
    
      (*2) currently just ignored, no Reset is sent
    
    This patch fixes the problem, by generating a Reset instead of silently
    ignoring option errors.

    selinux: add support for installing a dummy policy (v2)
    
    In August 2006 I posted a patch generating a minimal SELinux policy.  This
    week, David P. Quigley posted an updated version of that as a patch against
    the kernel.  It also had nice logic for auto-installing the policy.
    
    Following is David's original patch intro (preserved especially
    bc it has stats on the generated policies):
    
    se interested in the changes there were only two significant
    changes. The first is that the iteration through the list of classes
    used NULL as a sentinel value. The problem with this is that the
    class_to_string array actually has NULL entries in its table as place
    holders for the user space object classes.
    
    The second change was that it would seem at some point the initial sids
    table was NULL terminated. This is no longer the case so that iteration
    has to be done on array length instead of looking for NULL.
    
    Some statistics on the policy that it generates:
    
    The policy consists of 523 lines which contain no blank lines. Of those
    523 lines 453 of them are class, permission, and initial sid
    definitions. These lines are usually little to no concern to the policy
    developer since they will not be adding object classes or permissions.
    Of the remaining 70 lines there is one type, one role, and one user
    statement. The remaining lines are broken into three portions. The first
    group are TE allow rules which make up 29 of the remaining lines, the
    second is assignment of labels to the initial sids which consist of 27
    lines, and file system labeling statements which are the remaining 11.
    
    In addition to the policy.conf generated there is a single file_contexts
    file containing two lines which labels the entire system with base_t.
    
    This policy generates a policy.23 binary that is 7920 bytes.
    
    (then a few versions later...):
    
    The new policy is 587 lines (stripped of blank lines) with 476 of those
    lines being the boilerplate that I mentioned last time. The remaining
    111 lines have the 3 lines for type, user, and role, 70 lines for the
    allow rules (one for each object class including user space object
    classes), 27 lines to assign types to the initial sids, and 11 lines for
    file system labeling. The policy binary is 9194 bytes.
    
    Changelog:
    
    	Aug 26: Added Documentation/SELinux.txt
    	Aug 26: Incorporated a set of comments by Stephen Smalley:
    		1. auto-setup SELINUXTYPE=dummy
    		2. don't auto-install if selinux is enabled with
    			non-dummy policy
    		3. don't re-compute policy version
    		4. /sbin/setfiles not /usr/sbin/setfiles
    	Aug 22: As per JMorris comments, made sure make distclean
    		cleans up the mdp directory.
    		Removed a check for file_contexts which is now
    		created in the same file as the check, making it
    		superfluous.

    x86: default to reboot via ACPI
    
    Triple-fault and keyboard reset may assert INIT instead of RESET; however
    INIT is blocked when Intel VT is enabled.  This leads to a partially reset
    machine when invoking emergency_restart via sysrq-b: the processor is still
    working but other parts of the system are dead.
    
    Default to rebooting via ACPI, which correctly asserts RESET and reboots the
    machine.
    
    This is safe since we will fall back to keyboard reset and triple fault if
    acpi is not enabled or if the reset is not successful.

    xen: implement CPU hotplugging
    
    Note the changes from 2.6.18-xen CPU hotplugging:
    
    A vcpu_down request from the remote admin via Xenbus both hotunplugs the
    CPU, and disables it by removing it from the cpu_present map, and removing
    its entry in /sys.
    
    A vcpu_up request from the remote admin only re-enables the CPU, and does
    not immediately bring the CPU up. A udev event is emitted, which can be
    caught by the user if he wishes to automatically re-up CPUs when available,
    or implement a more complex policy.

    x86_32: clean up play_dead
    
    The removal of the CPU from the various maps was redundant as it already
    happened in cpu_disable.
    
    After cleaning this up, cpu_uninit only resets the tlb state, so rename
    it and create a noop version for the X86_64 case (so the two play_deads
    can be unified later).

    ALSA: Allocate larger pages in sgbuf
    
    Most hardwares have limited buffer-descriptor table length.  This
    also restricts the max buffer size of the sound driver.
    For example, snd-hda-intel has 1MB buffer size limit, and this is
    because it can have at most 256 BDL entries.  For supporting larger
    buffers, we need to allocate larger pages even for sg-buffers.
    
    This patch changes the sgbuf allocation code to try to allocate
    larger pages first.  At each head of the allocated pages, the
    number of allocated pages is stored in the lowest bits of the
    corresponding entry of the table addr field.  This change isn't
    visible as long as the driver uses snd_sgbuf_get_addr() helper.
    
    Also, the patch adds a new function, snd_pcm_sgbuf_get_chunk_size().
    This returns the size of the chunk on continuous pages starting at
    the given position offset.  If the chunk reaches to a non-continuous
    page, it returns the size to the boundary.

    sparc: Add mutex for set property calls.
    
    On some platforms, the I2C controller is shared between the OS and
    OBP.  OBP uses this I2C controller to access the EEPROM, and thus is
    programmed when the kernel calls prom_setprop().
    
    Wrap such calls with the new of_set_property_mutex.
    
    Relevant I2C bus drivers can grab this mutex around top-level I2C
    operations to provide the proper protection.

    x86: use x2apic id reported by cpuid during topology discovery
    
    use x2apic id reported by cpuid during topology discovery, instead of the
    apic id configured in the APIC. For most of the systems, x2apic id
    reported by cpuid leaf 0xb will be same as the physical apic id reported
    by the APIC_ID register of the APIC. We follow the suggested guidelines
    and use the apic id reported by the cpuid.
    
    No change to non-generic UV platforms, will use the apic id reported in the
    APIC_ID register as the cpuid reported apic id's may not be unique.

    rt2x00: Gather channel information in structure
    
    Channel information which is read from EEPROM should
    be read into an array containing per-channel information.
    This removes the requirement of multiple arrays and makes
    the channel handling a bit cleaner and easier to expand.

    rt2x00: Implement HW encryption
    
    Various rt2x00 devices support hardware encryption.
    
    Most of them require the IV/EIV to be generated by mac80211,
    but require it to be provided seperately instead of within
    the frame itself. This means that rt2x00lib should extract
    the data from the frame and place it in the frame descriptor.
    During RX the IV/EIV is provided in the descriptor by the
    hardware which means that it should be inserted into the
    frame by rt2x00lib.

    replace net_device arguments with ieee80211_{local,sub_if_data} as appropriate
    
    This patch replaces net_device arguments to mac80211 internal functions
    with ieee80211_{local,sub_if_data} as appropriate.
    
    It also does the same for many 802.11s mesh functions, and changes the
    mesh path table to be indexed on sub_if_data rather than net_device.
    
    If the mesh part needs to be a separate patch let me know, but since
    mesh uses a lot of mac80211 functions which were being converted anyway,
    the changes go hand-in-hand somewhat.
    
    This patch probably does not convert all the functions which could be
    converted, but it is a large chunk and followup patches will be
    provided.

    rfkill: introduce RFKILL_STATE_MAX
    
    While it is interesting to not add last-enum-markers because it allows gcc
    to warn us of switch() statements missing a valid state, we really should
    be handling memory corruption on a rfkill state with default clauses,
    anyway.
    
    So add RFKILL_STATE_MAX and use it where applicable.  It makes for safer
    code in the long run.

    rfkill: add __must_check annotations
    
    rfkill is not a small, mere detail in wireless support.  Once it starts
    supporting rfkill and users start counting on that support, a wireless
    device is at risk of operating in dangerous conditions should rfkill
    support fail to properly activate.
    
    Therefore, add the required __must_check annotations on some key functions
    of the rfkill API, for which the wireless drivers absolutely MUST handle
    the failure mode safely in order to avoid a potentially dangerous situation
    where the wireless transmitter is left enabled when the user don't want it
    to.

    rfkill: add default global states (v2)
    
    Add a second set of global states, "rfkill_default_states", to track the
    state that will be used when the first rfkill class of a given type is
    registered, and also to save "undo" information when rfkill_epo is called.
    
    Add a new exported function, rfkill_set_default(), which can be used by
    platform drivers to restore radio state saved by the platform across
    reboots or shutdown.
    
    Also, fix rfkill_epo to properly update rfkill_states, but still preserve a
    copy of the state so that we can undo the effect of rfkill_epo later if we
    want to.  Add rfkill_restore_states() to restore rfkill_states from the
    copy.

    ath5k: rates cleanup
    
    cleanup the rates structures used by ath5k. instead of separate driver and
    mac80211 rate structures we now setup a static ieee80211_rate array and use it
    directly. no conversion between two different rate structures has to be done
    any more. a lot of unused and confusing junk was deleted.
    
    renamed ath5k_getchannels into ath5k_setup_bands because this is what it does.
    rewrote it to copy the bitrates correctly for each band. this is necessary for
    running different hardware with the same driver (e.g. 5211 and 5212 based
    cards).
    
    add special handling of rates for AR5211 chipsets: it uses different rate codes
    for CCK rates (which are actually like the other chips but with a 0xF mask).
    
    setup a hardware code to rate index reverse mapping table for getting the rate
    index of received frames.
    
    the rates for control frames which have to be set in
    ath5k_hw_write_rate_duration are now in one single array.

    wait_task_inactive: "improve" the returned value for ->nvcsw == 0
    
    wait_task_inactive() returns 1 when p->nvcsw == 0 || p->nvcsw == 1.  This
    means that two subsequent calls can return the same number while the task
    was scheduled in between.
    
    Change the code to return "nvcsw | LONG_MIN" instead of "nvcsw ?: 1", now
    the overlap always needs LONG_MAX schedules.

    wait_task_inactive(): don't consider task->nivcsw
    
    If wait_task_inactive() returns success the task was deactivated.  In that
    case schedule() always increments ->nvcsw which alone can be used as a
    "generation counter".
    
    If the next call returns the same number, we can be sure that the task was
    unscheduled.  Otherwise, because we know that .on_rq == 0 again, ->nvcsw
    should have been changed in between.
    
    Q: perhaps it is better to do "ncsw = (p->nvcsw << 1) | 1" ?  This
    decreases the possibility of "was it unscheduled" false positive when
    ->nvcsw == 0.

    agp: enable optimized agp_alloc_pages methods
    
    The pageattr-array patch that you currently have in tip/master only
    enables it for intel-agp, not the others. The attached enables it for
    all drivers currently directly using agp_generic_alloc_page() and
    agp_generic_destroy_page() (ocal driver is amd-k7-agp).
    
    The new agp_generic_alloc_pages() interface uses the also new
    pageattr array interface API. This makes all AGP drivers that
    up to now used generic_{alloc,destroy}_page() use it.

    x86, paravirt_ops: use unsigned long instead of u32 for alloc_p*() pfn args
    
    This patch changes the pfn args from 'u32' to 'unsigned long'
    on alloc_p*() functions on paravirt_ops, and the corresponding
    implementations for Xen and VMI. The prototypes for CONFIG_PARAVIRT=n
    are already using unsigned long, so paravirt.h now matches the prototypes
    on asm-x86/pgalloc.h.
    
    It shouldn't result in any changes on generated code on 32-bit, with
    or without CONFIG_PARAVIRT. On both cases, 'codiff -f' didn't show any
    change after applying this patch.
    
    On 64-bit, there are (expected) binary changes only when CONFIG_PARAVIRT
    is enabled, as the patch is really supposed to change the size of the
    pfn args.

    [ARM] OMAP3 pwrdm: add hardware save-and-restore (SAR) support
    
    OMAP3430ES2+ introduces a new feature: optional powerdomain context
    hardware save-and-restore (SAR).  Currently, this feature only applies
    to USBHOST and USBTLL module context when the USBHOST or CORE
    powerdomains enter a low-power sleep state[1].  This feature avoids
    re-enumeration of USB devices when the powerdomains return from idle,
    which is potentially time-consuming.
    
    This patch adds support for enabling and disabling hardware
    save-and-restore to the powerdomain code.  Three new functions are
    added, pwrdm_enable_hdwr_sar(), pwrdm_disable_hdwr_sar(), and
    pwrdm_can_hdwr_sar().  A new struct powerdomain "flags" field is
    added, with a PWRDM_HAS_HDWR_SAR flag to indicate powerdomains with
    SAR support.
    
    Thanks to Jouni Högander <jouni.hogander@nokia.com> for reviewing an
    earlier version of these patches, and Richard Woodruff <r-woodruff2@ti.com>
    for clarifying the purpose of these bits.
    
    1.  For the USBHOST controller module, context loss occurs when the
        USBHOST powerdomain enters off-idle.  For USBTLL, context loss
        occurs either if CORE enters off-idle, or if the CORE logic is
        configured to turn off when CORE enters retention-idle (OSWR).

    rcu: use irq-safe locks
    
    Some earlier tip/core/rcu patches caused RCU to incorrectly enable irqs
    too early in boot.  This caused Yinghai's repeated-kexec testing to
    hit oopses, presumably due to so that device interrupts left over from
    the prior kernel instance (which would oops the newly booting kernel
    before it got a chance to reset said devices).  This patch therefore
    converts all the local_irq_disable()s in rcuclassic.c to local_irq_save().
    
    Besides, I never did like local_irq_disable() anyway.  ;-)

    xen: allow interrupts to be enabled while doing a blocking spin
    
    If spin_lock is called in an interrupts-enabled context, we can safely
    enable interrupts while spinning.  We don't bother for the actual spin
    loop, but if we timeout and fall back to blocking, it's definitely
    worthwhile enabling interrupts if possible.

    xen: save previous spinlock when blocking
    
    A spinlock can be interrupted while spinning, so make sure we preserve
    the previous lock of interest if we're taking a lock from within an
    interrupt handler.
    
    We also need to deal with the case where the blocking path gets
    interrupted between testing to see if the lock is free and actually
    blocking.  If we get interrupted there and end up in the state where
    the lock is free but the irq isn't pending, then we'll block
    indefinitely in the hypervisor.  This fix is to make sure that any
    nested lock-takers will always leave the irq pending if there's any
    chance the outer lock became free.

    i386: vmalloc size fix
    
    Booting kernel with vmalloc=[any size<=16m] will oops on my pc (i386/1G memory).
    
    BUG_ON in arch/x86/mm/init_32.c triggered:
    BUG_ON((unsigned long)high_memory > VMALLOC_START);
    
    It's due to the vm area hole.
    
    In include/asm-x86/pgtable_32.h:
    #define VMALLOC_OFFSET	(8 * 1024 * 1024)
    #define VMALLOC_START	(((unsigned long)high_memory + 2 * VMALLOC_OFFSET - 1) \
    			 & ~(VMALLOC_OFFSET - 1))
    
    There's several related point:
    1. MAXMEM :
     (-__PAGE_OFFSET - __VMALLOC_RESERVE).
    The space after VMALLOC_END is included as well, I set it to
    (VMALLOC_END - PAGE_OFFSET - __VMALLOC_RESERVE)
    
    2. VMALLOC_OFFSET is not considered in __VMALLOC_RESERVE
    fixed by adding VMALLOC_OFFSET to it.
    
    3. VMALLOC_START :
     (((unsigned long)high_memory + 2 * VMALLOC_OFFSET - 1) & ~(VMALLOC_OFFSET - 1))
    So it's not always 8M, bigger than 8M possible.
    I set it to ((unsigned long)high_memory + VMALLOC_OFFSET)
    
    4. the VMALLOC_RESERVE is an unused macro, so remove it here.

    allows it to enable interrupts while spinning, which could be

    x86-microcode: generic interface refactoring
    
    This is the 1st patch in the series. Here the aim was to avoid any
    significant changes, logically-wise.
    
    So it's mainly about generic interface refactoring: e.g. make
    microcode_{intel,amd}.c more about arch-specific details and less
    about policies like make-sure-we-run-on-a-target-cpu
    (no more set_cpus_allowed_ptr() here) and generic synchronization (no
    more microcode_mutex here).
    
    All in all, more line have been deleted than added.

    powerpc: Expose PMCs & cache topology in sysfs on 32-bit
    
    The file arch/powerpc/kernel/sysfs.c is currently only compiled for
    64-bit kernels.  It contain code to register CPU sysdevs in sysfs and
    add various properties such as cache topology and raw access by root
    to performance monitor counters (PMCs).  A lot of that can be re-used
    as is on 32-bits.
    
    This makes the file be built for both, with appropriate ifdef'ing
    for the few bits that are really 64-bit specific, and adds some
    support for the raw PMCs for 75x and 74xx processors.

    powerpc: Remove redundant sysfs_remove_file calls for cache info
    
    When removing a directory, the sysfs core takes care of removing files
    in the directory (see sysfs_remove_dir()).  So when we are about to
    delete a kobject (and thus cause its sysfs directory to be removed),
    we don't have to explicitly remove the files attached to it, although
    it's harmless to do so.

    powerpc: Split-out common MSI bitmap logic into msi_bitmap.c
    
    There are now two almost identical implementations of an MSI bitmap
    allocator, one in mpic_msi.c and the other in fsl_msi.c.
    
    Merge them together and put the result in msi_bitmap.c.  Some of the
    MPIC bits will remain to provide a nicer interface for the MPIC users.
    
    In the process we fix two buglets.  The first is that the allocation
    routines, now msi_bitmap_alloc_hwirqs(), returned an unsigned result,
    even though they use -1 to indicate allocation failure.  Although all
    the callers were checking correctly, it is much better for the routine
    to just return an int.  At least until someone wants > ~2 billion MSIs.
    
    The second buglet is that the device tree reservation logic only
    allowed power-of-two reservations.  AFAICT that didn't effect any
    existing code but it's nicer if we can reserve arbitrary irqs from MSI
    use.
    
    We also add some selftests, which exposed the two buglets and now test
    for them, as well as some basic sanity tests.  The tests are only built
    when CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL=y.

    machines this means we end up executing ~15 nops in ret_from_except_lite.
    
    It would be nicer if non-iSeries could skip the code entirely, and on
    iSeries we can jump out of line to execute the code.
    
    I have no performance numbers to justify this, other than the assertion
    that executing 15 nops takes longer than executing 0.

    We are a bit agressive in invalidating all the pages. But
    it is ok because we really don't know why the block allocation
    failed and it is better to come of the writeback path
    so that user can look for more info.

    percpu counter: clean up percpu_counter_sum_and_set()
    
    percpu_counter_sum_and_set() and percpu_counter_sum() is the same except
    the former updates the global counter after accounting.  Since we are
    taking the fbc->lock to calculate the precise value of the counter in
    percpu_counter_sum() anyway, it should simply set fbc->count too, as the
    percpu_counter_sum_and_set() does.
    
    This patch merges these two interfaces into one.

    sched: rt-bandwidth fixes
    
    The last patch allows sysctl_sched_rt_runtime to disable bandwidth accounting
    for the group scheduler - however it doesn't deal with sched_setscheduler(),
    which will keep tasks out of groups that have no assigned runtime.
    
    If we relax this, we get into the situation where RT tasks can get into a group
    when we disable bandwidth control, and then starve them by enabling it again.
    
    Rework the schedulability code to check for this condition and fail to turn
    on bandwidth control with -EBUSY when this situation is found.

    ARM: OMAP2: Clockdomain: Add base OMAP2/3 clockdomain code
    
    This patch creates an interface to the clockdomain registers in the
    PRM/CM modules on OMAP2/3.  This interface is intended to be used by
    PM code, e.g., pm.c; not by device drivers directly.
    
    The patch also adds clockdomain usecount tracking.  This is intended
    to be called whenever the first clock in a clockdomain is enabled, or
    when the last enabled clock in a clockdomain is disabled.  If the
    clockdomain is in software-supervised mode, the code will force-wakeup
    or force-sleep the clockdomain.  If the clockdomain is in
    hardware-supervised mode, the first clock enable will add sleep and
    wakeup dependencies on a user-selectable set of parent domains (usually
    MPU & IVA2), and the disable will remove them.
    
    Each clockdomain will be defined in later patches as static
    structures.  The clockdomain structures are linked into a list at boot
    by clkdm_register(), similar to the OMAP clock code.
    
    The patch adds a Kconfig option, CONFIG_OMAP_DEBUG_CLOCKDOMAIN, which
    when enabled will emit verbose debug messages via pr_debug().

    and software, don't obey this dictum.  Instead, probe for NOPL
    directly by executing a NOPL instruction and see if we get #UD.

    x86: boot: stub out unimplemented CPU feature words
    
    The CPU feature detection code in the boot code is somewhat minimal,
    and doesn't include all possible CPUID words.  In particular, it
    doesn't contain the code for CPU feature words 2 (Transmeta),
    3 (Linux-specific), 5 (VIA), or 7 (scattered).  Zero them out, so we
    can still set those bits as known at compile time; in particular, this
    allows creating a Linux-specific NOPL flag and have it required (and
    therefore resolvable at compile time) in 64-bit mode.

    x86: configuration options to compile out x86 CPU support code
    
    This patch adds some configuration options that allow to compile out
    CPU vendor-specific code in x86 kernels (in arch/x86/kernel/cpu). The
    new configuration options are only visible when CONFIG_EMBEDDED is
    selected, as they are mostly interesting for space savings reasons.
    
    An example of size saving, on x86 with only Intel CPU support:
    
       text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
    1125479	 118760	 212992	1457231	 163c4f	vmlinux.old
    1121355	 116536	 212992	1450883	 162383	vmlinux
      -4124   -2224       0   -6348   -18CC +/-
    
    However, I'm not exactly sure that the Kconfig wording is correct with
    regard to !64BIT / 64BIT.

    x86: move cmpxchg fallbacks to a generic place
    
    arch/x86/kernel/cpu/intel.c defines a few fallback functions
    (cmpxchg_*()) that are used when the CPU doesn't support cmpxchg
    and/or cmpxchg64 natively. However, while defined in an Intel-specific
    file, these functions are also used for CPUs from other vendors when
    they don't support cmpxchg and/or cmpxchg64. This breaks the
    compilation when support for Intel CPUs is disabled.
    
    This patch moves these functions to a new
    arch/x86/kernel/cpu/cmpxchg.c file, unconditionally compiled when
    X86_32 is enabled.

    x86: make movsl_mask definition non-CPU specific
    
    movsl_mask is currently defined in arch/x86/kernel/cpu/intel.c, which
    contains code specific to Intel CPUs. However, movsl_mask is used in
    the non-CPU specific code in arch/x86/lib/usercopy_32.c, which breaks
    the compilation when support for Intel CPUs is compiled out.
    
    This patch solves this problem by moving movsl_mask's definition close
    to its users in arch/x86/lib/usercopy_32.c.

    This patch changes GART IOMMU to return a size aligned address wrt
    dma_alloc_coherent, as DMA-mapping.txt defines:
    
    The cpu return address and the DMA bus master address are both
    guaranteed to be aligned to the smallest PAGE_SIZE order which
    is greater than or equal to the requested size.  This invariant
    exists (for example) to guarantee that if you allocate a chunk
    which is smaller than or equal to 64 kilobytes, the extent of the
    buffer you receive will not cross a 64K boundary.

    r8169: add hw start helpers for the 8168 and the 8101
    
    This commit triggers three 'defined but not used' warnings but
    I prefer avoiding to tie these helpers to a specific change in
    the hw start sequences of the 8168 or of the 8101.

Author: Mathieu Desnoyers <mathieu.desnoyers@polymtl.ca>
Date:   Thu Aug 14 16:58:15 2008 -0400

    x86: alternatives : fix LOCK_PREFIX race with preemptible kernel and CPU hotplug
    
    If a kernel thread is preempted in single-cpu mode right after the NOP (nop
    about to be turned into a lock prefix), then we CPU hotplug a CPU, and then the
    thread is scheduled back again, a SMP-unsafe atomic operation will be used on
    shared SMP variables, leading to corruption. No corruption would happen in the
    reverse case : going from SMP to UP is ok because we split a bit instruction
    into tiny pieces, which does not present this condition.
    
    Changing the 0x90 (single-byte nop) currently used into a 0x3E DS segment
    override prefix should fix this issue. Since the default of the atomic
    instructions is to use the DS segment anyway, it should not affect the
    behavior.
    
    The exception to this are references that use ESP/RSP and EBP/RBP as
    the base register (they will use the SS segment), however, in Linux
    (a) DS == SS at all times, and (b) we do not distinguish between
    segment violations reported as #SS as opposed to #GP, so there is no
    need to disassemble the instruction to figure out the suitable segment.
    
    This patch assumes that the 0x3E prefix will leave atomic operations as-is (thus
    assuming they normally touch data in the DS segment). Since there seem to be no
    obvious ill-use of other segment override prefixes for atomic operations, it
    should be safe. It can be verified with a quick
    
    grep -r LOCK_PREFIX include/asm-x86/
    grep -A 1 -r LOCK_PREFIX arch/x86/
    
    Taken from
    
    This source :
    AMD64 Architecture Programmer's Manual Volume 3: General-Purpose and System
    Instructions
    States
    "Instructions that Reference a Non-Stack Segment—If an instruction encoding
    references any base register other than rBP or rSP, or if an instruction
    contains an immediate offset, the default segment is the data segment (DS).
    These instructions can use the segment-override prefix to select one of the
    non-default segments, as shown in Table 1-5."
    
    Therefore, forcing the DS segment on the atomic operations, which already use
    the DS segment, should not change.
    
    This source :
    http://wiki.osdev.org/X86_Instruction_Encoding
    States
    "In 64-bit the CS, SS, DS and ES segment overrides are ignored."
    
    Confirmed by "AMD 64-Bit Technology" A.7
    http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/white_papers_and_tech_docs/x86-64_overview.pdf
    
    "In 64-bit mode, the DS, ES, SS and CS segment-override prefixes have no effect.
    These four prefixes are no longer treated as segment-override prefixes in the
    context of multipleprefix rules. Instead, they are treated as null prefixes."
    
    This patch applies to 2.6.27-rc2, but would also have to be applied to earlier
    kernels (2.6.26, 2.6.25, ...).
    
    Performance impact of the fix : tests done on "xaddq" and "xaddl" shows it
    actually improves performances on Intel Xeon, AMD64, Pentium M. It does not
    change the performance on Pentium II, Pentium 3 and Pentium 4.

    Used http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/ttest1.cfm?Format=C to do the
    T-test (yeah, I'm lazy) :
    
     Group      Group One (DS prefix)       Group Two (nops)
     Mean                    34.37815               34.37070
     SD                       0.46108                0.51905
     SEM                      0.10310                0.11606
     N                             20                     20
    
    P value and statistical significance:
      The two-tailed P value equals 0.9620
      By conventional criteria, this difference is considered to be not statistically significant.
    
    Confidence interval:
      The mean of Group One minus Group Two equals 0.00745
      95% confidence interval of this difference: From -0.30682 to 0.32172
    
    Intermediate values used in calculations:
      t = 0.0480
      df = 38
      standard error of difference = 0.155
    
    So, unless these calculus are completely bogus, the difference between the nop
    and the DS case seems not to be statistically significant.

    rcu: just rename call_rcu_bh instead of making it a macro
    
    Seems that I found a box that has a config that passes call_rcu_bh as a
    function pointer (see net/sctp/sm_make_chunk.c), so declaring the
    call_rcu_bh has a macro function isn't good enough.
    
    This patch makes it just another name of call_rcu for rcupreempt.

    x86, pat: avoid highmem cache attribute aliasing
    
    Highmem code can leave ptes and tlb entries around for a given page even after
    kunmap, and after it has been freed.
    
    >From what I can gather, the PAT code may change the cache attributes of
    arbitrary physical addresses (ie. including highmem pages), which would result
    in aliases in the case that it operates on one of these lazy tlb highmem
    pages.
    
    Flushing kmaps should solve the problem.
    
    I've also just added code for conditional flushing if we haven't got
    any dangling highmem aliases -- this should help performance if we
    change page attributes frequently or systems that aren't using much
    highmem pages (eg. if < 4G RAM). Should be turned into 2 patches, but
    just for RFC...

    o	the memory barrier in rcu_exit_nohz() somehow got out of place
    	(it is correct in mainline as of 2.6.26-rc7).
    
    o	There is a duplicate declaration of rcu_dyntick_sched.

    reduce tlb/cache flush times of agpgart memory allocation
    
    To reduce tlb/cache flush, makes agp memory allocation do one flush
    after all pages in a region are changed to uc.
    
    All agp drivers except agp-sgi uses agp_generic_alloc_page()
    for .agp_alloc_page, so the patch should work for them. agp-sgi is only
    for ia64, so not a problem too.

    introduce two APIs for page attribute
    
    Introduce two APIs for page attribute. flushing tlb/cache in every page
    attribute is expensive. AGP gart usually will do a lot of operations to
    change a page to uc, new APIs can reduce flush.

    x86, bootup: add built-in kernel command line for x86 (v2)
    
    Allow x86 to support a built-in kernel command line.  The built-in
    command line can override the one provided by the boot loader, for
    those cases where the boot loader is broken or it is difficult
    to change the command line in the the boot loader.

    OK. This version changes absolutely nothing if CONFIG_CMDLINE_BOOL is not
    set (the default).  Also, no space is appended even when CONFIG_CMDLINE_BOOL
    is set, but the builtin string is empty.  This is less sloppy all the way
    around, IMHO.
    
    Note that I use the same option names as on other arches for
    this feature.

    rcu: classic RCU locking and memory-barrier cleanups
    
    This patch simplifies the locking and memory-barrier usage in the Classic
    RCU grace-period-detection mechanism, incorporating Lai Jiangshan's
    feedback from the earlier version (http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/8/1/400
    and http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/8/3/43).  Passed 10 hours of
    rcutorture concurrent with CPUs being put online and taken offline on
    a 128-hardware-thread Power machine.  My apologies to whoever in the
    Eastern Hemisphere was planning to use this machine over the Western
    Hemisphere night, but it was sitting idle and...
    
    So this is ready for tip/core/rcu.
    
    This patch is in preparation for moving to a hierarchical
    algorithm to allow the very large SMP machines -- requested by some
    people at OLS, and there seem to have been a few recent patches in the
    4096-CPU direction as well.  The general idea is to move to a much more
    conservative concurrency design, then apply a hierarchy to reduce
    contention on the global lock by a few orders of magnitude (larger
    machines would see greater reductions).  The reason for taking a
    conservative approach is that this code isn't on any fast path.
    
    Prototype in progress.
    
    This patch is against the linux-tip git tree (tip/core/rcu).  If you
    wish to test this against 2.6.26, use the following set of patches:
    
    http://www.rdrop.com/users/paulmck/patches/2.6.26-ljsimp-1.patch
    http://www.rdrop.com/users/paulmck/patches/2.6.26-ljsimpfix-3.patch
    
    The first patch combines commits 5127bed588a2f8f3a1f732de2a8a190b7df5dce3
    and 3cac97cbb14aed00d83eb33d4613b0fe3aaea863 from Lai Jiangshan
    <laijs@cn.fujitsu.com>, and the second patch contains my changes.

    happen during unload of IPVS, because during normal operation there is at least
    our global stats structure in the estimator list. The mod_timer() and

    Fix date output in x86 microcode driver.
    
    The microcode stores its date in a uint32_t in some weird order
    approximating pdp-endian. Rather than printing it like that, print it
    properly in ISO standard form.

    ALSA: hda - Don't reset SPDIF in each status change
    
    The SPDIF output is toggled at each time any SPDIF status bits are changed
    because of the known problems on some codecs.  But, this also results in
    loosing the sync, and the problem is more obvious on HDMI output over
    SPDIF.  Since the toggle is necessary only for some codecs, we should
    check whether this workaround is needed and skip if unnecessary.

    GFS2: Fix metafs mounts
    
    This patch is intended to fix the issues reported in bz #457798. Instead
    of having the metafs as a separate filesystem, it becomes a second root
    of gfs2. As a result it will appear as type gfs2 in /proc/mounts, but it
    is still possible (for backwards compatibility purposes) to mount it as
    type gfs2meta. A new mount flag "meta" is introduced so that its possible
    to tell the two cases apart in /proc/mounts.
    
    As a result it becomes possible to mount type gfs2 with -o meta and
    get the same result as mounting type gfs2meta. So it is possible to
    mount just the metafs on its own. Currently if you do this, its then
    impossible to mount the "normal" root of the gfs2 filesystem without
    first unmounting the metafs root. I'm not sure if thats a feature or
    a bug :-)
    
    Either way, this is a great improvement on the previous scheme and I've
    verified that it works ok with bind mounts on both the "normal" root
    and the metafs root in various combinations.
    
    There were also a bunch of functions in super.c which didn't belong there,
    so this moves them into ops_fstype.c where they can be static. Hopefully
    the mount/umount sequence is now more obvious as a result.

    rcu, debug: detect stalled grace periods
    
    this is a diagnostic patch for Classic RCU.
    
    The approach is to record a timestamp at the beginning
    of the grace period (in rcu_start_batch()), then have
    rcu_check_callbacks() complain if:
    
     1.	it is running on a CPU that has holding up grace periods for
     	a long time (say one second).  This will identify the culprit
     	assuming that the culprit has not disabled hardware irqs,
     	instruction execution, or some such.
    
     2.	it is running on a CPU that is not holding up grace periods,
     	but grace periods have been held up for an even longer time
     	(say two seconds).
    
    It is enabled via the default-off CONFIG_DEBUG_RCU_STALL kernel parameter.
    
    Rather than exponential backoff, it backs off to once per 30 seconds.
    My feeling upon thinking on it was that if you have stalled RCU grace

    selinux: conditional expression type validation was off-by-one
    
    expr_isvalid() in conditional.c was off-by-one and allowed
    invalid expression type COND_LAST. However, it is this header file
    that needs to be fixed. That way the if-statement's disjunction's
    second component reads more naturally, "if expr type is greater than
    the last allowed value" ( rather than using ">=" in conditional.c):
    
      if (expr->expr_type <= 0 || expr->expr_type > COND_LAST)

    ALSA: snd_usb_audio: fix SB Extigy IR Remote regression
    
    The support for the SB Extigy's remote seems to be broken in all
    recent ALSA versions, including 1.0.17. The driver detects the event
    correctly, then submits a URB to query the RC code. On the Extigy, the
    URB is submitted with a length of 2 bytes. My hardware, however, only
    replies with 1 byte, containing the correct RC button code. The
    current implementation discards this as being too short. (line 1784 of
    usbmixer.c)
    
    This patch specifies a "minimum packet length" in the remote control
    configuration. I've left the values for the Audigy 2/Live! the same as
    the packet length, as I'm assuming the existing code works with them.
    (I don't have the hardware to confirm) This fixes the Extigy RC
    support, e.g. for use with Lirc.

    Use the wss detection code and kill the ad1848 library.
    The library is fully assimilated into the new wss library.
    
    This required reworking of the AD1848 family code
    so the code is changed to correctly detect chips from
    the AD1848 and CS4231 families.
    
    I have tested it on following cards:
    Gallant SC-6600 (codec: AD1848, driver: snd-sc6600)
    SoundScape VIVO/90 (codec: AD1845, driver: snd-sscape)
    SG Waverider (codec: CS4231A, driver: Rene Herman's snd-galaxy)
    Opti930 (codec: built-in - CS4231 compatible, driver: snd-opti93x)
    Opti931 (codec: built-in - CS4231 compatible, driver: snd-opti93x)
    Gallant SC-70P (chip/codec: CS4237B, driver: snd-cs4236)
    Audio Plus 3D (chip/codec: CMI8330A, driver: snd-cmi8330)
    Dell Latitude CP (chip/codec: cs4236, driver snd-cs4232)

    smack: limit privilege by label
    
    There have been a number of requests to make the Smack LSM
    enforce MAC even in the face of privilege, either capability
    based or superuser based. This is not universally desired,
    however, so it seems desirable to make it optional. Further,
    at least one legacy OS implemented a scheme whereby only
    processes running with one particular label could be exempt
    from MAC. This patch supports these three cases.
    
    If /smack/onlycap is empty (unset or null-string) privilege
    is enforced in the normal way.
    
    If /smack/onlycap contains a label only processes running with
    that label may be MAC exempt.
    
    If the label in /smack/onlycap is the star label ("*") the
    semantics of the star label combine with the privilege
    restrictions to prevent any violations of MAC, even in the
    presence of privilege.
    
    Again, this will be independent of the privilege scheme.

    ALSA: Fix limit of 8 PCM devices in SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_PCM_NEXT_DEVICE
    
    When compiled with CONFIG_SND_DYNAMIC_MINORS the ALSA core is fine
    to have more than 8 PCM devices per card, except one place - the
    SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_PCM_NEXT_DEVICE ioctl, which will not enumerate
    devices > 7. This patch fixes the issue, changing the devices list
    organisation.
    
    Instead of adding new device to the tail, the list is now kept always
    ordered (by card number, then device number). Thus, during enumeration,
    it is easy to discover the fact that there is no more given card's
    devices.
    
    Additionally the device field of struct snd_pcm had to be changed to int,
    as its "unsignednity" caused a lot of problems when comparing it to
    potentially negative signed values. (-1 is 0xffffffff or even more then ;-)

    hpet: /dev/hpet - fixes and cleanup
    
    Minor /dev/hpet updates and bugfixes:
    
      * Remove dead code, mostly remnants of an incomplete/unusable
        kernel interface ... noted when addressing "sparse" warnings:
          + hpet_unregister() and a routine it calls
          + hpet_task and all references, including hpet_task_lock
          + hpet_data.hd_flags (and HPET_DATA_PLATFORM)
    
      * Correct and improve boot message:
          + displays *counter* (shared between comparators) bit width,
            not *timer* bit widths (which are often mixed)
          + relabel "timers" as "comparators"; this is less confusing,
            they are not independent like normal timers are (sigh)
          + display MHz not Hz; it's never less than 10 MHz.
    
      * Tighten and correct the userspace interface code
          + don't accidentally program comparators in 64-bit mode using
            32-bit values ... always force comparators into 32-bit mode
          + provide the correct bit definition flagging comparators with
            periodic capability ... the ABI is unchanged
    
      * Update Documentation/hpet.txt
          + be more correct and current
          + expand description a bit
          + don't mention that now-gone kernel interface
    
    Plus, add a FIXME comment for something that could cause big trouble
    on systems with more capable HPETs than at least Intel seems to ship.
    
    It seems that few folk use this userspace interface; it's not very
    usable given the general lack of HPET IRQ routing.  I'm told that
    the only real point of it any more is to mmap for fast timestamps;
    IMO that's handled better through the gettimeofday() vsyscall.

    xen_alloc_ptpage: cast PFN_PHYS() argument to unsigned long
    
    Currently paravirt_ops alloc_p*() uses u32 for the pfn args. We should
    change that later, but while the pfn parameter is still u32, we need to
    cast the PFN_PHYS() argument at xen_alloc_ptpage() to unsigned long,
    otherwise it will lose bits on the shift.
    
    I think PFN_PHYS() should behave better when fed with smaller integers,
    but a cast to unsigned long won't be enough for all cases on 32-bit PAE,
    and a cast to u64 would be overkill for most users of PFN_PHYS().
    
    We could have two different flavors of PFN_PHYS: one for low pages
    only (unsigned long) and another that works for any page (u64)),
    but while we don't have it, we will need the cast to unsigned long on
    xen_alloc_ptpage().

    x86, xsave: dynamically allocate sigframes fpstate instead of static allocation
    
    dynamically allocate fpstate on the stack, instead of static allocation
    in the current sigframe layout on the user stack. This will allow the

    information supporting xsave/xrstor.
    
    signal handlers will be able to access the fpstate pointer from the
    sigcontext structure asusual, with no change. For the non RT sigframe's
    (which are supported only for 32bit apps), current static fpstate layout
    in the sigframe will be unused(so that we don't change the extramask[]
    offset in the sigframe and thus prevent breaking app's which modify
    extramask[]).

    ALSA: Fix limit of 8 PCM devices in SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_PCM_NEXT_DEVICE
    
    When compiled with CONFIG_SND_DYNAMIC_MINORS the ALSA core is fine
    to have more than 8 PCM devices per card, except one place - the
    SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_PCM_NEXT_DEVICE ioctl, which will not enumerate
    devices > 7. This patch fixes the issue, changing the devices list
    organisation.
    
    Instead of adding new device to the tail, the list is now kept always
    ordered (by card number, then device number). Thus, during enumeration,
    it is easy to discover the fact that there is no more given card's
    devices. The same limit was present in OSS emulation code. It has
    been fixed as well.
    
    Additionally the device field of struct snd_pcm is now int, instead of
    unsigned int, as there is no obvious reason for keeping it unsigned.
    This caused a lot of problems with comparing this value with other
    (almost always signed) variables. There is just one more place where
    device number is unsigned - in struct snd_pcm_info, which should be
    also sorted out in future.

    ALSA: ASoC: Add all CODECs Kconfig option
    
    Allow all the CODEC drivers to be built without a machine driver in order
    to facilitate testing of subsystem-wide changes and gain better coverage
    from automated testing efforts. This also helps things like the generic
    OpenFirmware machine driver for PowerPC.
    
    Currently AC97 CODECs are not included since the current setup relies
    on having a controller driver available.

    ALSA: ASoC: Add OpenFirmware helper for matching bus and codec drivers
    
    Simple utility layer for creating ASoC machine instances based on data
    in the OpenFirmware device tree.  OF aware platform drivers and codec
    drivers register themselves with this framework and the framework
    automatically instantiates a machine driver.  At the moment, the driver
    is not very capable and it is expected to be extended as more features
    are needed for specifying the configuration in the device tree.
    
    This is most likely temporary glue code to work around limitations in
    the ASoC v1 framework.  When v2 is merged, most of this driver will
    need to be reworked.

    ALSA: Build jack detection
    
    Since jack detection requires the input subsystem which may not be
    desired on small systems it is not built unless required by a driver
    that is being built. Drivers using jack detection should use a pattern
    like this:
    
    config SND_FOO
            tristate "..."
            ...
            select SND_JACK if INPUT=y || INPUT=SND
    
    to ensure that the jack detection API is enabled if the input subsystem
    is.  If the input subsystem is not enabled then a stub version of the
    API is provided.

    ALSA: Add jack reporting API
    
    Currently very few systems provide information about jack status to user
    space, even though many have hardware facilities to do detection. Those
    systems that do use an input device with the existing SW_HEADPHONE_INSERT
    switch type to do so, often independently of ALSA.
    
    This patch introduces a standard method for representing jacks to user
    space into ALSA. It allows drivers to register jacks for a sound card with
    the input subsystem, binding the input device to the card to help user
    space associate the input devices with their sound cards. The created
    input devices are named in the form "card longname jack" where jack is
    provided by the driver when allocating a jack. By default the parent for
    the input device is the sound card but this can be overridden by the
    card driver.
    
    The existing user space API with SW_HEADPHONE_INSERT is preserved.

    x86: AMD microcode patch loading support
    
    This patch introduces microcode patch loading for AMD
    processors. It is based on previous corresponding work
    for Intel processors.
    
    It hooks into the general patch loading module. Main
    difference is that a container file format is used to hold
    all patch data for multiple processors as well as an
    equivalent CPU table, which comes seperately, as opposed
    to Intel's microcode patching solution.
    
    Kconfig and Makefile have been changed provice config
    and build option for new source file.

    x86: major refactoring
    
    Refactored code by introducing a two-module solution.
    
    There is one general module in which vendor specific modules can hook into.
    However, that is exclusive, there is only one vendor specific module
    allowed at a time. A CPU vendor check makes sure only the correct
    module for the underlying system gets called.
    
    Functinally in terms of patch loading itself there are no changes. This
    refactoring provides a basis for future implementations of other vendors'
    patch loaders.

    vendors and that need to be accessed from the general module.

    xen: suppress known wrmsrs
    
    In general, Xen doesn't support wrmsr from an unprivileged domain; it
    just ends up ignoring the instruction and printing a message on the
    console.
    
    Given that there are sets of MSRs we know the kernel will try to write
    to, but we don't care, just eat them in xen_write_msr to cut down on
    console noise.

    x86: L3 cache index disable for 2.6.26
    
    New versions of AMD processors have support to disable parts
    of their L3 caches if too many MCEs are generated by the
    L3 cache.
    
    This patch provides a /sysfs interface under the cache
    hierarchy to display which caches indices are disabled
    (if any) and to monitoring applications to disable a
    cache index.
    
    This patch does not set an automatic policy to disable
    the L3 cache.  Policy decisions would need to be made
    by a RAS handler.  This patch merely makes it easier to
    see what indices are currently disabled.

    xen: fix allocation and use of large ldts
    
    When the ldt gets to more than 1 page in size, the kernel uses vmalloc
    to allocate it.  This means that:
    
     - when making the ldt RO, we must update the pages in both the vmalloc
       mapping and the linear mapping to make sure there are no RW aliases.
    
     - we need to use arbitrary_virt_to_machine to compute the machine addr
       for each update

    x86/oprofile: introduce model specific init/exit functions
    
    This patch implements model specific OProfile init/exit functions for
    x86 CPUs. Though there is more rework needed at the initialization
    code, this new introduced functions allow it to keep model specific
    code in the corresponding op_model_*.c files.
    
    The function interface is the same as for oprofile_arch_init/exit().

     Dump all the PIC, local APIC and I/O APIC information at the
    fs_initcall() level, which is after ACPI (if used) has initialised PCI
    information, making the point of invocation consistent across MP-table and
    ACPI platforms.  Remove explicit calls to print_IO_APIC() from elsewhere.
    Make the interface of all the functions involved consistent between 32-bit
    and 64-bit versions and make them all static by default by the means of a
    New-and-Improved(TM) __apicdebuginit() macro.
    
     Note that like print_IO_APIC() all these only output anything if
    "apic=debug" has been passed to the kernel through the command line.

    x86: split spinlock implementations out into their own files
    
    ftrace requires certain low-level code, like spinlocks and timestamps,
    to be compiled without -pg in order to avoid infinite recursion.  This
    patch splits out the core paravirt spinlocks and the Xen spinlocks
    into separate files which can be compiled without -pg.
    
    Also do xen/time.c while we're about it.  As a result, we can now use
    ftrace within a Xen domain.

    This patch is the result of an automatic script that consolidates the
    format of all the headers in include/asm-x86/.
    
    The format:
    
    1. No leading underscore. Names with leading underscores are reserved.
    2. Pathname components are separated by two underscores. So we can
       distinguish between mm_types.h and mm/types.h.
    3. Everything except letters and numbers are turned into single
       underscores.

    x64, apic: use generic apic_write() for ack_APIC_irq()
    
    I tested tip/master and found an issue (patch attached)
    for x2apic support. This is not because of the recent merges we had, but
    because of something(where we still access memory based interface after
    enabling x2apic mode) that slipped through my earlier tests.
    
    Probably it is a good idea to unmap the memory mapped interface, once we switch
    to x2apic mode. That will catch the issues much earlier. I will
    post another patch for this.
    
    ack_APIC_irq() is used at too many generic places (and not just during
    irq_chip handling!) to use the native_apic_mem_write(). For ex, this will
    break x2apic based systems.
    
    Fix ack_APIC_irq() to use the generic apic_write() even for 64-bit.

    This way we can remove UV, x2apic specific code from genapic_64.c and
    move them to their specific genapic files.

    rcu classic: new algorithm for callbacks-processing(v2)
    
    This is v2, it's a little deference from v1 that I
    had send to lkml.
    use ACCESS_ONCE
    use rcu_batch_after/rcu_batch_before for batch # comparison.
    
    rcutorture test result:
    (hotplugs: do cpu-online/offline once per second)
    
    No CONFIG_NO_HZ:           OK, 12hours
    No CONFIG_NO_HZ, hotplugs: OK, 12hours
    CONFIG_NO_HZ=y:            OK, 24hours
    CONFIG_NO_HZ=y, hotplugs:  Failed.
    (Failed also without my patch applied, exactly the same bug occurred,
    http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/7/3/24)
    
    v1's email thread:
    http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/6/2/539
    
    v1's description:
    
    The code/algorithm of the implement of current callbacks-processing
    is very efficient and technical. But when I studied it and I found
    a disadvantage:
    
    In multi-CPU systems, when a new RCU callback is being
    queued(call_rcu[_bh]), this callback will be invoked after the grace
    period for the batch with batch number = rcp->cur+2 has completed
    very very likely in current implement. Actually, this callback can be
    invoked after the grace period for the batch with
    batch number = rcp->cur+1 has completed. The delay of invocation means
    that latency of synchronize_rcu() is extended. But more important thing
    is that the callbacks usually free memory, and these works are delayed
    too! it's necessary for reclaimer to free memory as soon as
    possible when left memory is few.
    
    A very simple way can solve this problem:
    a field(struct rcu_head::batch) is added to record the batch number for
    the RCU callback. And when a new RCU callback is being queued, we
    determine the batch number for this callback(head->batch = rcp->cur+1)
    and we move this callback to rdp->donelist if we find
    that head->batch <= rcp->completed when we process callbacks.
    This simple way reduces the wait time for invocation a lot. (about
    2.5Grace Period -> 1.5Grace Period in average in multi-CPU systems)
    
    This is my algorithm. But I do not add any field for struct rcu_head
    in my implement. We just need to memorize the last 2 batches and
    their batch number, because these 2 batches include all entries that
    for whom the grace period hasn't completed. So we use a special
    linked-list rather than add a field.
    Please see the comment of struct rcu_data.

    rcu classic: simplify the next pending batch
    
    use a batch number(rcp->pending) instead of a flag(rcp->next_pending)
    
    rcu_start_batch() need to change this flag, so mb()s is needed
    for memory-access safe.
    
    but(after this patch applied) rcu_start_batch() do not change
    this batch number(rcp->pending), rcp->pending is managed by
    __rcu_process_callbacks only, and troublesome mb()s are eliminated.
    
    And codes look simpler and clearer.

    x64, x2apic/intr-remap: add x2apic support, including enabling interrupt-remapping
    
    x2apic support.  Interrupt-remapping must be enabled before enabling x2apic,
    this is needed to ensure that IO interrupts continue to work properly after the
    cpu mode is changed to x2apic(which uses 32bit extended physical/cluster
    apic id).
    
    On systems where apicid's are > 255, BIOS can handover the control to OS in
    x2apic mode. Or if the OS handover was in legacy xapic mode, check
    if it is capable of x2apic mode. And if we succeed in enabling
    Interrupt-remapping, then we can enable x2apic mode in the CPU.

    x64, x2apic/intr-remap: MSI and MSI-X support for interrupt remapping infrastructure
    
    MSI and MSI-X support for interrupt remapping infrastructure.
    
    MSI address register will be programmed with interrupt-remapping table
    entry(IRTE) index and the IRTE will contain information about the vector,
    cpu destination, etc.
    
    For MSI-X, all the IRTE's will be consecutively allocated in the table,
    and the address registers will contain the starting index to the block
    and the data register will contain the subindex with in that block.
    
    This also introduces a new irq_chip for cleaner irq migration (in the process
    context as opposed to the current irq migration in the context of an interrupt.
    interrupt-remapping infrastructure will help us achieve this).
    
    As MSI is edge triggered, irq migration is a simple atomic update(of vector
    and cpu destination) of IRTE and flushing the hardware cache.

    x64, x2apic/intr-remap: IO-APIC support for interrupt-remapping
    
    IO-APIC support in the presence of interrupt-remapping infrastructure.
    
    IO-APIC RTE will be programmed with interrupt-remapping table entry(IRTE)
    index and the IRTE will contain information about the vector, cpu destination,
    trigger mode etc, which traditionally was present in the IO-APIC RTE.
    
    Introduce a new irq_chip for cleaner irq migration (in the process
    context as opposed to the current irq migration in the context of an interrupt.
    interrupt-remapping infrastructure will help us achieve this cleanly).
    
    For edge triggered, irq migration is a simple atomic update(of vector
    and cpu destination) of IRTE and flush the hardware cache.
    
    For level triggered, we need to modify the io-apic RTE aswell with the update
    vector information, along with modifying IRTE with vector and cpu destination.
    So irq migration for level triggered is little  bit more complex compared to
    edge triggered migration. But the good news is, we use the same algorithm
    for level triggered migration as we have today, only difference being,
    we now initiate the irq migration from process context instead of the
    interrupt context.
    
    In future, when we do a directed EOI (combined with cpu EOI broadcast
    suppression) to the IO-APIC, level triggered irq migration will also be
    as simple as edge triggered migration and we can do the irq migration
    with a simple atomic update to IO-APIC RTE.
    
    TBD: some tests/changes needed in the presence of fixup_irqs() for
    level triggered irq migration.

    x64, x2apic/intr-remap: disable DMA-remapping if Interrupt-remapping is detected (temporary quirk)
    
    Interrupt-remapping enables queued invalidation. And once queued invalidation
    is enabled, IOTLB invalidation also needs to use the queued invalidation
    mechanism and the register based IOTLB invalidation doesn't work.
    
    For now, Support for IOTLB invalidation using queued invalidation is
    missing. Meanwhile, disable DMA-remapping, if Interrupt-remapping
    support is detected.
    
    For the meanwhile, if someone wants to really enable DMA-remapping, they
    can use nox2apic, which will disable interrupt-remapping and as such
    doesn't enable queued invalidation.
    
    And given that none of the release platforms support intr-remapping yet,
    we should be ok for this temporary hack.

    genapic's read_apic_id() returns the actual apic id extracted from
    the APIC_ID register. And in some cases like UV, read_apic_id()
    returns completely different values from APIC ID register.
    
    Use the native apic register read, rather than genapic read_apic_id()
    in verify_local_APIC()
    
    And also, lapic_suspend() should also use native apic register read.

    x64, x2apic/intr-remap: fix the need for sequential array allocation of iommus
    
    Clean up the intel-iommu code related to deferred iommu flush logic. There is
    no need to allocate all the iommu's as a sequential array.
    
    This will be used later in the interrupt-remapping patch series to
    allocate iommu much early and individually for each device remapping
    hardware unit.

    MM: virtual address debug
    
    Add some (configurable) expensive sanity checking to catch wrong address
    translations on x86.
    
    - create linux/mmdebug.h file to be able include this file in
      asm headers to not get unsolvable loops in header files
    - __phys_addr on x86_32 became a function in ioremap.c since
      PAGE_OFFSET, is_vmalloc_addr and VMALLOC_* non-constasts are undefined
      if declared in page_32.h
    - add __phys_addr_const for initializing doublefault_tss.__cr3
    
    Tested on 386, 386pae, x86_64 and x86_64 numa=fake=2.
    
    Contains Andi's enable numa virtual address debug patch.

    HPET timer's IRQ is 0 by default. So we have to select which irq
    will be used by these timers. We wait to set the timer's irq until
    we really open it in order to reduce the chance of conflicting with
    other device.

    percpu: introduce DEFINE_PER_CPU_PAGE_ALIGNED() macro
    
    While examining holes in percpu section I found this :
    
    c05f5000 D per_cpu__current_task
    c05f5000 D __per_cpu_start
    c05f5004 D per_cpu__cpu_number
    c05f5008 D per_cpu__irq_regs
    c05f500c d per_cpu__cpu_devices
    c05f5040 D per_cpu__cyc2ns
    
    <Big Hole of about 4000 bytes>
    
    c05f6000 d per_cpu__cpuid4_info
    c05f6004 d per_cpu__cache_kobject
    c05f6008 d per_cpu__index_kobject
    
    <Big Hole of about 4000 bytes>
    
    c05f7000 D per_cpu__gdt_page
    
    This is because gdt_page is a percpu variable, defined with
    a page alignement, and linker is doing its job, two times because of .o
    nesting in the build process.
    
    I introduced a new macro DEFINE_PER_CPU_PAGE_ALIGNED() to avoid
    wasting this space. All page aligned variables (only one at this time)
    are put in a separate
    subsection .data.percpu.page_aligned, at the very begining of percpu zone.
    
    Before patch , on a x86_32 machine :
    
    .data.percpu                30232   3227471872
    .data.percpu                22168   3227471872
    
    Thats 8064 bytes saved for each CPU.

    x86, ptrace: PEBS support
    
    Polish the ds.h interface and add support for PEBS.
    
    Ds.c is meant to be the resource allocator for per-thread and per-cpu
    BTS and PEBS recording.
    It is used by ptrace/utrace to provide execution tracing of debugged tasks.
    It will be used by profilers (e.g. perfmon2).
    It may be used by kernel debuggers to provide a kernel execution trace.
    
    Changes in detail:
    - guard DS and ptrace by CONFIG macros
    - separate DS and BTS more clearly
    - simplify field accesses
    - add functions to manage PEBS buffers
    - add simple protection/allocation mechanism
    - added support for Atom
    
    Opens:
    - buffer overflow handling
      Currently, only circular buffers are supported. This is all we need
      for debugging. Profilers would want an overflow notification.
      This is planned to be added when perfmon2 is made to use the ds.h
      interface.
    - utrace intermediate layer
