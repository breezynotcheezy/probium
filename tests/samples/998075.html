<P>ON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI<BR>
TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS<BR>
FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT<BR>
</P>

<P>REPLY BRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES</P>

<P>Respondent has provided no persuasive reason for this Court to leave
unreviewed the Ninth Circuit's &quot;general rule&quot; (Pet. App. 6a),
which conflicts with the decisions of other circuits, that expert testimony
concerning the compartmentalized structure and modus operandi of drug-trafficking
organizations is inadmissible in simple drug-importation prosecutions. That
evidence is important in helping the jury understand an activity-drug smuggling-that
is foreign to most jurors, and provides a context for the jury to evaluate
other evidence, as well as gaps in evidence. The Ninth Circuit's categorical
exclusion of that evidence already has resulted in the reversal of numerous
convictions, and it warrants this Court's review. 1</P>

<P>A. The Ninth Circuit Categorically Excludes The Expert Testimony At Issue.
Respondent asserts that the Ninth Circuit has not established a &quot;categorical
bar&quot; to admission of the type of expert testimony at issue. Br. in
Opp. 12; see id. at 10, 12-13, 28-29. That argument is contradicted by the
Ninth Circuit's own decisions, not to mention the demonstrable impact that
the rule of United States v. Vallejo, 237 F.3d 1008, amended, 246 F.3d 1150
(2001), already has had on drug-importation convictions in that circuit.
See Pet. 9 (citing cases in which the Ninth Circuit has reversed convictions
under Vallejo).</P>

<P>As explained (Pet. 8-9), in Vallejo, the Ninth Circuit unequivocally
held that expert testimony &quot;concerning the structure and modus operandi
of drug trafficking organizations&quot; is not relevant in a simple drug-importation
prosecution brought under 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1), 952, and 960, and that such
testimony is &quot;unfairly prejudicial.&quot; 237 F.3d at 1017. The Ninth
Circuit panel in this case plainly grasped the categorical nature of that
&quot;general rule.&quot; Pet. App. 6a (&quot;[N]one of the reasons given
by the district court remove this case from Vallejo's general rule.&quot;).
So too, the Ninth Circuit's discussion of Vallejo in United States v. Pineda-Torres,
287 F.3d 860, 863-866 (2002), petition for cert. pending, No. 02-112 (filed
July 22, 2002), underscores the general applicability of Vallejo's prohibition.2</P>

<P>Respondent notes that in both Vallejo and this case, the Ninth Circuit
faulted the government for not establishing a specific evidentiary link
between the defendant and a particular drug-trafficking organization. See
Br. in Opp. 12, 16-17; Pet. App. 5a (&quot;Neither Vallejo, nor McGowan,
was charged with conspiracy, and in neither case did the government introduce
any evidence establishing a connection between the defendant and a drug
trafficking organization.&quot;) (citing Vallejo, 237 F.3d at 1015). But
respondent fails to account for the fact that-given the compartmentalization
in functions in drug-trafficking organizations, see Pet. App. 37a-38a-such
evidence is generally unavailable to the government in a simple drug-courier
prosecution such as this case and the others in which the Ninth Circuit
has applied its Vallejo bar. The result is that the gov ernment typically
will be unable to supply the evidentiary prerequisite-i.e., evidence linking
the defendant to a particular drug-trafficking organization- necessary,
in the Ninth Circuit alone, to present a jury with the type of expert testimony
at issue.</P>

<P>Respondent claims that decisions such as United States v. Valencia-Amezcua,
278 F.3d 901 (2002), show that the Ninth Circuit has &quot;rejected challenges
to modus operandi testimony.&quot; Br. in Opp. 14. Valencia-Amezcua, however,
does not fit the common fact-pattern in which the Ninth Circuit applies
&quot;Vallejo's general rule.&quot; Pet. App. 6a. Valencia-Amezcua did not
involve a drug-importation prosecution, but rather a prosecution for illegally
manufacturing and possessing methamphetamine. See 278 F.3d at 905. As explained
in the petition (Pet. 9), the Ninth Circuit has been unwavering in its application
of its Vallejo rule to exclude the expert testimony at issue in simple drug-importation
prosecutions such as this, by far the most common type of drug prosecution
in border districts in the Ninth Circuit like the Southern District of California.
See Pet. 20.</P>

<P>B. This Case Is Well-Suited To Address The Question Presented. Respondent
states (Br. in Opp. 13) that this case is not a &quot;proper vehicle&quot;
in which to consider the validity of &quot;Vallejo's general rule&quot;
(Pet. App. 6a). That is incorrect. The question presented is squarely and
properly presented by his case, as adequately evidenced alone by the fact
that the Ninth Circuit applied its Vallejo rule to reverse the convictions
in this case. See id. at 5a-7a.</P>

<P>Nor is respondent correct in suggesting that the record fails to support
the government's challenge to the Vallejo rule. See Br. in Opp. 13-14. As
explained in the petition (Pet. 3), the government sought to introduce the
expert testimony at issue to &quot;give a context to the situation of what
is actually occurring&quot; in order to &quot;help[]&quot; the jury understand
&quot;the smuggling activity itself,&quot; as well as to help explain &quot;why
taking fingerprints is not necessarily helpful in this type of case.&quot;
Pet. App. 11a. The district court allowed the evidence for those purposes,
stating, inter alia, that the evidence at issue is &quot;important for the
jury to understand how the systems works,&quot; as well as why there may
not be &quot;evidence that shows [that the defendant] touched the drug&quot;
or &quot;loaded the drug.&quot; Id. at 15a-16a; see id. at 16a (&quot;[The
evidence] helps th[e] jury understand something that they don't know about.&quot;).
And the expert testimony that was presented at trial by Special Agent Villars
served those functions. See id. at 29a-53a.</P>

<P>Respondent argues that there is &quot;no justification&quot; for the
expert testimony at issue to explain the lack of fingerprints because, he
asserts, the government's own expert testified that gasoline would &quot;destroy[]
any fingerprint evidence.&quot; Br. in Opp. 14. Special Agent Villars, however,
testified that there were &quot;several reasons&quot; why fingerprint evidence
is not helpful in a case such as this. Pet. App. 36a. In particular, he
testified not only that it is difficult to lift prints from the packaging
normally used to transport drugs across the border, especially when it is
placed in gasoline, but also that &quot;the person who normally loads the
vehicle is not the person who drives it.&quot; Id. at 36a-38a. The compartmentalization
testimony was key because, as Special Agent Villars emphasized, it means
that &quot;if we were able to lift a print, it would be of somebody south
of the border.&quot; Id. at 36a (emphasis added). That is important to know
because in most simple drug-importation cases in which drugs are secreted
in a car, including this one, the government does not even attempt to recover
fingerprint evidence from the packaging containing drugs or the vehicle
itself for that very reason.</P>

<P>In any event, even if respondent's characterization of the Villars testimony
were correct, the testimony is still relevant and admissible to provide
the jury with an understanding of how drug-smuggling operations work. That
understanding is critical to enhance the jury's evaluation of the evidence
presented at trial, as well as to explain possible gaps in such evidence,
and the arguments made by both sides concerning whether someone who is stopped
at the border with drugs in his car but claims no knowledge of the drugs
could still have &quot;knowingly&quot; sought to import them into this country.
As explained (Pet. 13), the testimony is not introduced as an implicit statement
that persons such as respondent are drug couriers, but only that they might
be, even though the defendant claims no knowledge of the drugs in his car
and there is not more physical evidence linking the defendant to the drugs.
A jury is left to draw its own conclusion based on inferences that it may
reasonably draw from the evidence.3</P>

<P>C. The Circuit Conflict Is Genuine. Respondent attempts to reconcile
&quot;Vallejo's general rule&quot; (Pet. App. 6a) with the decisions in
other circuits that have allowed the sort of expert testimony categorically
barred by the Ninth Circuit, asserting that &quot;not a single case cited
by the Solicitor General conflicts with Vallejo.&quot; Br. in Opp. 14. That
argument cannot be squared with the case law discussed in the petition (Pet.
16-19), in which courts of appeals outside the Ninth Circuit have readily
allowed expert testimony concerning the structure and modus operandi of
drug-trafficking organizations in similar drug-smuggling prosecutions. Indeed,
later in his opposition, respondent himself acknowledges that there is &quot;tension&quot;
between the cases discussed in the petition and on which he now relies.
Br. in Opp. 30.</P>

<P>Respondent claims (Br. in Opp. 28) that there is no conflict because
the cases from other circuits do not focus on the need for the government
to show a link between the defendant and a particular drug-trafficking organization
as a prerequisite to introducing the type of expert testimony at issue.
It is true that the cases do not focus on, or require, such a link. But
far from dispelling the conflict, the fact that the other circuits have
not adopted such an evidentiary prerequisite further underscores the novelty
of the Ninth Circuit's Vallejo rule.</P>

<P>For example, in United States v. Foster, 939 F.2d 445 (1991), the Seventh
Circuit did not focus on whether the government had shown that the defendant
was tied to a specific drug-trafficking organization. Rather, in upholding
the trial court's admission of the modus operandi expert testimony at issue,
the court emphasized that the testimony was relevant and admissible to place
the evidence &quot;in context&quot; for the jury, and &quot;to offer another
explanation for [seemingly innocent] behavior.&quot; Id. at 451-452. So
too, in United States v. Chin, 981 F.2d 1275, 1279 (1992), cert. denied,
508 U.S. 923 (1993), the D.C. Circuit did not suggest that the admissibility
of expert testimony on drug-trafficking operations is contingent on establishing
that the defendant belongs to a particular drug-trafficking organization,
but instead recognized that such evidence &quot;is 'commonly admitted.'&quot;
In the Ninth Circuit, by contrast, such expert testimony is not admissible
in a drug-importation prosecution unless the government establishes an evidentiary
link between the defendant and a particular drug-trafficking organization.4</P>

<P>Respondent's reliance on cases barring the admission of &quot;'drug-courier
profile' evidence&quot; is misplaced. Br. in Opp. 29; see id. 29-30. As
explained (Pet. 15 n.6), although it can take different forms, so-called
drug-courier profile evidence typically is used to link characteristics
of the defendant to a generalized profile of drug couriers used in investigations
and to argue, based on that comparison, that the defendant is guilty. For
example, in United States v. Brito, 136 F.3d 397, 412 (5th Cir.), cert.
denied, 523 U.S. 1128 (1998), relied upon by respondent, the witness &quot;described
a profile of family drug organizations and then compared the [defendants']
actions to that profile.&quot; The court of appeals held that &quot;[t]his
type of profile evidence is inadmissible to prove substantive guilt based
on similarities between defendants and a profile.&quot; Ibid. By contrast,
the type of expert testimony at issue in this case is not introduced to
compare a defendant to an investigative profile of known criminals, but
instead, inter alia, to provide the jury with a general understanding of
a trade about which jurors usually lack familiarity and a context in which
to evaluate the evidence, as well as possible gaps in evidence, at trial.5</P>

<P>Respondent claims that the petition in this case &quot;jump[s] the gun,&quot;
because other circuits have not explicitly rejected Vallejo. Br. in Opp.
28. As discussed (Pet. 16-19), however, the Vallejo rule is clearly out
of step with the decisions in other circuits concerning the admissibility
of expert testimony on the structure and modus operandi of drug-trafficking
operations. Moreover, certiorari is warranted based on the immediate and
serious impact that the Vallejo rule has had in the Ninth Circuit-home to
the Nation's busiest ports of entry with Mexico-on the government's effort
to stem the tide of illegal drugs being smuggled into this country. Cf.
United States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 7 (1989) (&quot;We grant certiorari
to review the decision of the [Ninth Circuit] because of its serious implications
for the enforcement of the federal narcotics laws.&quot;) (citation omitted).</P>

<P>D. Respondent's Arguments On The Merits Provide No Reason For Denying
Certiorari. Respondent's effort to defend the merits of &quot;Vallejo's
general rule&quot; fares no better than the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit
in adopting and applying that rule. Br. in Opp. 15, 20-27. As the government
has explained (Pet. 10-15), the Ninth Circuit's categorical prohibition
on admission of the type of expert testimony at issue conflicts with both
a textual and common-sense reading of the Federal Rules of Evidence and
overrides the traditionally broad discretion that trial courts enjoy in
admitting evidence. In particular, respondent errs in suggesting that Old
Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172 (1997), &quot;supports the Court of
Appeals' decision&quot; in this case. Br. in Opp. 25; see id. at 27. Old
Chief provides no support for the Vallejo rule; to the contrary, it only
casts further doubt on that rule. See Pet. 14-15. In any event, respondent's
arguments on the merits are premature at this stage and provide no basis
for denying certiorari.</P>

<P>E. The Question Presented Is Demonstrably Important. Finally, respondent
states that the government's concern (see Pet. 20) over the impact of &quot;Vallejo's
general rule&quot; (Pet. App. 6a) on the administration of justice is unfounded.
Br. in Opp. 35. But the number of convictions-including those in this case-
that already have been invalidated by the Ninth Circuit under Vallejo proves
just the opposite. See Pet. 9. Simple drug-importation prosecutions analogous
to the prosecution in this case recur continuously-indeed, well more than
a thousand times a year-in the Southern District of California and the District
of Arizona. This Court should grant review and decide whether the admission
of the expert testimony at issue is, as the Ninth Circuit has categorically
held, proscribed by the Federal Rules of Evidence.</P>

<P>* * * * *</P>

<P>For the foregoing reasons and those stated in the petition, the petition
for a writ of certiorari should be granted.</P>

<P>Respectfully submitted.</P>

<P>SEPTEMBER 2002<BR>
</P>

<P>1 Respondent has filed a conditional cross-petition for certiorari (No.
02-5976), raising two questions involving the constitutionality and interpretation
of 21 U.S.C. 952 and 960 in light of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466
(2000). The government has filed a separate opposition to that cross-petition.</P>

<P>2 On July 22, 2002, the government filed a petition for a writ of certiorari
in Pineda-Torres (No. 02-112) presenting the same question as the petition
in this case. The petition in No. 02-112 asks the Court to hold the case
and dispose of it in light of the disposition in this case. On September
13, 2002, the Clerk directed the respondent in No. 02-112 to file a response
to the petition on or before October 15, 2002.</P>

<P>3 Respondent states that the government &quot;appears to concede that
no affirmative mention of fingerprints was made until after Agent Villars
testified on direct.&quot; Br. in Opp. 11 n.4. As noted (Pet. 7 n.3), however,
respondent's counsel laid the groundwork for an argument based on the absence
of fingerprints when she asked Inspector Williams-before Special Agent Villars
took the stand -whether he &quot;use[d] gloves&quot; when he removed the
drugs from respondent's vehicle. 8/29/00 Tr. 245. In any event, the government's
ability to inform jurors about the structure and modus operandi of drug-trafficking
organizations should not turn on a defendant's decision whether to point
to the lack-of-fingerprint evidence. Among other things, as this case illustrates,
defense counsel may allude to the lack of fingerprints, while maintaining
that the defendant has not affirmatively raised such a defense. In addition,
even when a defendant makes no reference to the lack of fingerprints or
other physical evidence tying him to drugs found in his car, a jury on its
own may well draw a negative inference from the fact that the government
did not present such evidence. See Pet. 11.</P>

<P>4 United States v. Long, 917 F.2d 691 (2d Cir. 1990), relied upon by
respondent (Br. in Opp. 28), does not support the Ninth Circuit's Vallejo
rule. Long involved a RICO prosecution against teamsters officials with
organized crime contacts. The Second Circuit held that the trial court improperly
admitted certain expert testimony concerning &quot;organized crime.&quot;
Id. at 701. But far from adopting the sort of categorical prohibition established
by the Ninth Circuit in Vallejo, the Second Circuit in Long carefully grounded
its decision in the particular circumstances of that case, including its
determination that there was &quot;no need to call an expert to explain
[how organized crime families operate]&quot; when one of the fact witnesses,
a member of an organized crime family, could have provided such an explanation.
Id. at 702.</P>

<P>5 The other drug-courier profile cases cited by respondent are similarly
inapposite. See, e.g., United States v. Jones, 913 F.2d 174, 177 (4th Cir.
1990) (drug-courier profile evidence was erroneously admitted when government
sought to use evidence not as &quot;purely background material,&quot; but
instead &quot;to establish the defendant's guilt by showing that he has
the same characteristics as a drug courier&quot;), cert. denied, 498 U.S.
1052 (1991).
